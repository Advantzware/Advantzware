Install:
  Extract the contents of the zipfile to a dir. Keep
  path names as defined in the zip, so you should end
  up with a directory containing 10 files and
  one directory called "static"

Run:
  Open your editor, and run "launch.p" with a fully
  specified path. If you installed HtmlDict to
  D:\data\progress\htmldict then you should use:
  run D:\data\progress\htmldict\launch.p
