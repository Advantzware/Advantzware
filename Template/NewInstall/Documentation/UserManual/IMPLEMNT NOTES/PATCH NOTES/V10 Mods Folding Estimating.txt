                    They will enter percentage that will be saved for this estimate if recalculated.
                    The percentage will be multiplied by TOTAL FACTORY COST, exactly as warehousing percentage is cal
                    culated.  The Markup Percentage will print below warehousing.
                    Hence, if warehouse percentage is 10% and Markup% is 10%, they will be same dollar value.
                    Estimate will show Factory Markup.
                    
                    This will add to FULL Cost and is used in Margin, Commision and Sell Price Calculation.
                    All estimate types.

                    	B) CORRUGATED ESTIMATES USE - BROKER %
                    
                    3) DEFAULT AS FOLLOWS WITH OPTION TO REMOVE OR CHANGE IF NECESSARY:
                    	A) FOLDING ESTIMATES DEFAULT TO 5%
                    	B) CORRUGATED ESTIMATES DEFAULT TO 0
                       ESP - Added two new default fields to Cost Estimate Control.
                    
                    
                    
E- - -   01190701 E COPY Button on MISC folder
                    Add new COPY button for both Folding & Corrugated estimating.  The copy feature on this miscellan
                    eous page would allow copy of a Misc / Subcontract cost to many forms for tandem, sets and combo 
                    estimates.  This would work similar to the COPY FILM button on the layout screen.
E- - -   03110903 E Commission Calculation (Additional Hrs @ $100/Hr per Task 08250811)
                    See Attached.  (Similar to Task  03030910 )
                    Estimate was calculated twice.  
                    The first calculation shows a commission of 4% sell price $44,266.  
                    The second calculation price was changed to on the item screen .
                    The total selling price for the estimate goes to a sell price of $44,268 and the commission goes 
                    down to 3.8%.  
                    How is that possible?  
                    Since the sell price is now a couple $$ higher, the commission should stay the same or increase s
                    lightly.

E- - -   06040922 E Do not create FG with category of "D"isplay
                    They had a mod done a while back (Jeff did the Mod) where when they have the catgeory of "DSPLC" 
                    they had wanted the FG to get created with the first character being a "D".  They no-longer want 
                    that to use a "D".
                    This should go back to using a "C" for Corrugated and a "F" for folding even though the category 
                    is DSPLC. 
                    This just needs to be commented out of the code.

                    Available Margin dollars = Sell Price - Full Cost - Commission
                    For Example.
                    Full Cost less commission = $460. Assume 40% margin finds 4% commission.
                    If they want 40% margin then Sell Price is $ 766.6666
                    Full Cost w/o Coomm is $460, Commission = $ 262, Net Profit = $2,360.
                    
                    The What If analysis, change the Margin and recalculate a new sales price.  Likewise, if they ent
                    er a sales price, the system will subtract Margin Cost to equal Margin Dollars.  
                    Margin Dollars / Sell Price = Margin Percent which finds Commmission Percent.
                    
                    Therefore on  What If screen, changing margin should change sell price and Net %. Changing Sell P
                    rice should change Net% and Margin %.

                    First, if FLAT COMM% in customer file is greater than 0, then that is the Specs commission %.
                    
                    Second, if FLAT COMM% = zero, then the Customer Markup = Margin on the Matrix. 
                    The program will find the available margin percentage in the salesman matrix and transfer the com
                    mission% for that margin from the salesman's matrix to the spec file. 
                    If Custer Markup is 13% , the comission will be next lower margin = 4%
                    If customer markup is 20% the commission is 6%

                    he estimate.   They want to add a markup for trim / waste to the MSF calculation to be multiplied
                     by the Sell Price per MSF defined in the Customer Pricing Matrix folder by Style and MSF.

                     Calculation Only.   Hence they could add 1.02 for 1-2/16 inches to the width and .08 for 8/16 in
                    ches to the length.  Hence if the style file would calculate a different MSF total if either fiel

                    No other MSF calculations would use the new trim/waste fields.
                    
                    Lastly, the WHATIF button shows the Price per MSF so that he can override this number.

                    .  The purpose of the modifcation is to project the reording of parts that have projected life ti
                    mes.  For example motors and belts wear out, but the key is to have the parts available to repair
                     the machine to minimize downtime.  The new file will tie directly with the raw materials file to
                     utilize reorder levels.  There are no need to duplicate fields already in the raw materials file
                    :  The new file will have the following fields.

                    Current logic copyies all flutes from one style to another style. This now copies scores from one
                     style to another style. Currently, if the user selects *, this will copy to all styles.
                    
                    New Option in the style file to copy from Flute to Flute. 
                    New option called From Style = SAME and To Style = SAME.
                    This will only copy all styles but only From Flute to Flute within each Style.
                    Score allowances for DW will be copied to AB from RSC to RSC and 
                    Score allowances for DW will be copied to AB from HSC to HSC and 
                    Score allowances for DW will be copied to AB from FOL to FOL.
                    Meaning, this will not copy to other styles.
                    
                    They have score allowances defined for DW for all styles.  This new option would allow to copy sc
                    ore allowance from flutes such as EC,BC,AB, AC ect.
                    They don't want to have to go into each style and add the scoring for each style and each flute.

                     waste and Run Quantity).  This logic updates the machine parts file regardless of die number or 
                    plate number.
                    
                    We do something similar to this for dies and plates, where we update the number of impressions on
                     a die.  (See Old Task# 01250703).  This old task looks for a die number or plate number.

                    Please add:
                    Flute take-up, Reg Starch, WP (water proof) Starch and Other Starch as follows:
                    Sample:

                    Flute_Takeup    Numeric  99.999      (this would be a value such as 1.331)
                    Reg_starch         Numeric  999.99     (this would be a value such as .35 as in 35 cents)

                    Other_starch       Numeric  999.99     (this would be a value such as .35 as in 35 cents)
                    ************************************************************
                    The take up factor would be for individual flutes.  
                    Replace the BOM shrink value with the take-up factor.  Change the calculation to multiply the med
                    ium cost by the take up (rather than the current divide bythe recipical of the shrink factor).
                    Add an 8th line to the BOM screen called starch.  Pull in the starch cost per MSF and multiply it
                     by the blank size.    Add a column to the estimate tab screen called starch.  Default it to R fo
                    r regular, but allow an over-ride to W or O (water proof or other).  
                    Hide this column if a grade without a BOM is selected. 
E-B-6-   06070708 E New Button called Import Excel

                     format.
                    This will overwrite the existing data for the pallet displayed.
                    Message should prompt, "Override Pattern Codes?"  Yes would transfer each column and width label 
                    and field.

                    The print folder has a calculate button that I added 100,000, then 150,000.  
                    This button will give the ability to update the Estimate Folder.
                    
                    Change logic for CALCULATE button to ONLY import Quantities from the ESTIMATE folder's quantities
                     via the F1 key on the quantity field.

                    Print Folder Quantities are erasing the Estimate folder quantities.
                    See ASI estimate 6116.    I entered 25,000, 50,000 and 75,000 then calculated.
                    Next, clients also wanted 125,000.  
                    I go to print folder and click buton update quantities and add 125,000.
                    However I do not want to calculate all 4 quantities again, just 125,000.
                    I then press CLEAR quantities or erase all but 125,000 then calcualte.
                    The estimate folder is updated.

                    Corrugated defaults to MSF, but folding should default to TON.
                    Even better, would be to default the override cost of board based on the VENDOR COST MATRIX unit 
                    of measure.
                    
                    Hence, the cost could be MSF, TON, MSH or whatever the normal cost method for that material.
E-F- -   04230902 E N-K CERoute#Out  ($75 per hour - Quoted at $5000)
                    New Parameter will allow updating the PREP/ROUTE folder Number Out for Diecutting (DC) and Gluing
                     (GL) via the OVERRIDE Button.
                    
                    N-K CERoute#Out 
                    Logical Value = YES,  allows updating the number out on machine routing screen for die cutting an
                    d gluing via the override button.
                    A new standard code = 30 will be added via the N-Z-7 matrix called Routing # Out.
                    This will allow adding machine standards by Routing # Out.
                    
                    When clicking the import button, the system currently imports the machine speeds from the machine
                     files standards matrixes.   If the machine file is defined by the new number 30 standard, then t
                    he run speed imported will be based on the number out entered on the machine routing.    This log
                    ic will only work for the DC and GL departments.
                    
                    Likewise, the PRINT folder, Calculate Button will be modified.
                    When the Recalc toggle Machine Run Speed is unchecked, no new logic is needed.
                    When the Recalc toggle Machine Run Speed is checked, the program must import the run speed based 
                    on the new #30 standard matrix code.
                    
                    In the machine file, number 30 validation will be added so that the #30 standard can only be adde
                    d to a machine listed in the DC or GL departments.

                        When I enter the blank number, I get an error.
                        If our estimate cannot calculate PREP cost by blank, then B should not be 
                        allowed to be updated.
                    
                    2)  Copy from S/B 1-1 to 1-2 does nothing.   Again, if we can calcuate PREP 
                        down to the blank number then this should work and add blank number to S/B
E-F- -   05170705 E Spec Folder, OVERRIDE should allow changing Square Inches
                    Overide allows changing the Blank Width and Blank Length.
                    Two changes are needed.
                    1) If I tab, the WxL /144 calculates the square inches.  However if I change W and L and click SA
                    VE without tab, the square inch is wrong.
                    2) If I change the TOTAL square Inches, this should remain.
                       Clients could change this due to a better manual or cad calculation.

                    1) Change Packaging Code to Pack Code to Save Space.
                    2)  Reduce Length, Width and Depth to 4 Decimals on Ink / Pack Folder
                    3)  Add Depth to Layer Pad
                    4)  Add Depth to Divider
                    5)  Move Qty on Layer Pad to a Column Heading next to Depth.
                    6)  Move Qty field under new Qty Column Heading
                    7)  When adding Layer Pad (material type 5) or Divider (material type 6) , the Length, width and 
                         depth will transfer from the raw materials folder.
                    
                    8) When adding Divider (material type 6) , the Length, width and depth will transfer from the raw

                    nt only.
                    
                    When checked, this logic will force the DC machine waste as ZERO for printed jobs, however for fo
                    rms without inks, the MR waste will be used.  When unchecked, the MR waste will always be used.
                    
                    This logic will work for the BUILD button and IMPORT button only as well as when the calculating 
                    the estimate with the toggle box "RECALC Machine Run Speeds, Spoil % Waste" is checked.  This log
                    ic must be used in single item, two piece, tandem and combo jobs for folding carton estimates and
                     job standards recalculations.  Hence, J-U recalc will use this new logic and JobStds buttons thr

E-F- -   10100703 E Override Button should not prompt to Update Box Design
                    Folding Carton estimates do not update the panel sizes on the box design screen.
                    Therefore, the OVERRIDE or AUTOCALC buttons should not prompt to update the box design. This shou
                    ld only apply to corrugated styles.  Likewise, when changing the style code via Override or Autoc
                    alc, this does not update box design, but should prompt.
                    
                    For folding estimates, changing the style code is the only reason to prompt to update the box des
                    ign.   We need the prompt because they may have added a different design.

                    e person entering Superior estimates because the estimates can have 20 to 40 items on it.  We nee
                    d someone to take a look at this and expedite the process for us.  It was never working like this
                     before.  In the past, it was very quick once you hit F1.

E-F- -   12120703 E Tape to Calculate Inches TIMES 4
                    The raw material type = T for tape currently calculates lineal inches of glue which is based on t
                    he box depth / lineal inches.    To support  rigid box cost for stay tape which is applied to 4 c
                    orners, we need to calculate multiply the lineal inches by 4.
                    When folding carton material = T
                          Total inches (EA) will be Lineal Inches times 4  times blank quantity / Lineal Inches per L
                    B.
                          LB will calculate exactly as EA.

                    Premier will be opening a sales & distribution office in Chicago.  
                    Database for both companies will run from company 001 Premier Packaging via Louisville, KY server
                    .  They want unique forms for the Chicago location which would have a new address and logo  assoc
                    iated with each form.
                    Therefore, the modification is for all forms to print by customer or vendor code.   Each forms pr
                    int routine must be changed to search for a specific form by vendor or customer.
                    The N-K-1 control parameter folder called "view form" tab (see attached) would house the specific
                     form by customer or vendor.   If this is BLANK, then the existing form defined on the VIEW FORM 
                    folder would print.  
                    Therefore each print routine must be changed to first search the VIEW FORM folder to select the f
                    orm based on the customer or vendor.  The following print routines must be changed:
                    By Customer :  QUOPRINT, JOBCARDC, ACKHEAD, BOLFMT, INVPRINT,STMTPRIN, 
                    By Vendor:       POPRINT, CHKFMT
                    All forms character value = PremierX
                    They would use the  PremierX forms but with New Company Logo and address changes.
                    Once I have the logo & address format I will create a separate task for each form.

                    When checked, then the quotes would print in a separate page per quote 
                    Current logic is when printing a range of quotes for same customer, the program will combined mul
                    tiple quotes onto 1 single quote form.    
                    This new modification is suppose to print a separate page for each quote on the range.
                    This option will use the existing screen that allows selecting multiple quotes separated by commo
                    ns or a range of quotes using the existing print selection fields, however the range of quotes wo
                    uld print each as a single item quote.  
                    Please note, once the options were select on the quote print screen, the system would save the se
                    ttings by the user ID so that the default print options would remain the same.

E-R-7-   06170905 E Change Report to Find Last Job# from J-U-1
                    A PREP code on an estimate may be used by many Finished Goods Items.
                    For example, PLATE may be used on many jobs.
                    The data collection module writes the LAST job number to the E-B-8 Prep file.
                    The E-R-7 report simply prints this job number.
                    This is not dynamic enough.
                    New Logic should find the last job number for the FG Item on the estimate.
                    
                    Examples of Bad Data at Fibre Follow:
                    Prep Code 4434 ? Shows last JOB 110219 (this is wrong).  It also shows last ORDER 110493 (this is
                     correct).
                    Prep Code 6919 ? Shows last JOB 98507 (this is wrong).  It also shows last ORDER 96419 (this is c
                    orrect).
                    Prep Code 7555 ? Shows last JOB 99053 (this is wrong).  It also shows last ORDER 116340 (this is 
                    correct).
                    Seems pretty consistent where the JOB # is wrong but the ORDER # is correct on these.
