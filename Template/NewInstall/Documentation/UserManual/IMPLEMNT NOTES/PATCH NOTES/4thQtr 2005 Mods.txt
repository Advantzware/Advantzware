                    he scoring for the 2nd formula will have the allowances for each flute code.
                    
                    This will allow for new programming logic in the future for a corrugated plant to produce a rever
                    se carton such as the style RTC in our corrugated style file.   Currently scoring allowances appl
                    y only to the first formula.

E-C- -   08270308 E New Foam Logic based on Die Size       BILL WHEN FINISHED
                    New DB Table to define each pass.  Gross Sheet Size will remain.   The net sheet size will be rep
                    laced with multiple In and Out sheet sizes.  New fields will include the  Pass 1, Pass 2, Pass 3.
                       Each Machine Pass will include the Sheet Size Feed In Width, Length and Depth,  Sheet Out Size
                     Length, Width and Depth and Number Out Width, Lenght and Depth.  The system will calculate the d
                    ie size as the current logic works, then the system will calculate the sheet size for each drop o
                    ff sheet including the number of out on each pass.  
                    
                    For example, the blank size is 10 x 5  x 2. If we use a stocked sheet of 50 x 110 x 2.  
                    The first pass would make 2 sheets 20 x 110 x2 and 1 drop off sheet of 10 x 110 x 2.   
                    
                    The 2nd pass would cut the 20 x 110 x 2 by the die size of 20 x 10 into 11 sheets or 44 blanks(4 
                    up x11).  The 3rd pass would make the same cut or Sheet In of 20 x 110 x 2 by the die size of 20 
                    x 10 into 11 sheets.  
                    
                    The 4th pass would cut the feed in sheet size of 10 x 110  by the 10 x 20 die into 5 sheets or 20
                     blanks (4 up x 5).   This would leave a drop off sheet of 10 x10 which would be die cut by 10x 2
                    0 or 1/2 die or 2 blanks. 
                    
                    The machine routing would utilize the number out on each pass to determine the number of sheets a
                    nd hence the number of hours for each pass.

                    Whatever range of warehouses are added to the range, the total on hand will be compared to the Re
                    order Level.    For example, we have an item called 10x10x10 and we have 500 in Warehoue A, 500 i
                    n Warehouse B and 500 in Warehouse C and 500 in MAIN location with a reorder level of 1000.    If
                     I run the report for all warehouses, the item will not show on the reorder advise report because
                     2000 on hand is greater than 1000.    If we ran this report for just MAIN then the quantity of 5
                    00 is less than 1000 and the item would be on the reorder advise report.   Default the new fields

                    EM which will create a separate invoice per item received.   New character value will be called A
                    LLITEMS, which will create a single invoice for all items for the same order together on one invo
                    ice.   Please note, the new logic must use the customer field field called Invoice per PO must be
                     used to determine if a single invoice for all items are if a separate invoice per unique purchas

                    Updating the Job Standards is overriding the dates in the machine routing that has been set by th
                    e scheduler.     We need SMARTS to know when to update the labor or more specificallly to NOT upd
                    ate the machine routing when the routing has been scheduled.   The start dates and times are the 
                    critical issues.
                    
                    should have popup to update Materials or Labor.
                    If the user simply update the inks in estimating, they have to rebuild the job to move the inks.
J-U-1-   10240506 E Fountain Pen Missing
                    Add Fountain Pen to Job File.   This is the same file as estimating, however we did work for note
                    s to only show job notes.   In any event, the fountain pen should be there.
J-U-1-   11290511 E Job Standards Updating the Routing (Old Task# 09300504)
                    Updating the Job Standards is overriding the dates in the machine routing that has been set by th
                    e scheduler.     We need SMARTS to know when to update the labor or more specificallly to update 
                    the machine routing when the routing has been scheduled but import the existing machine times and
                     dates.
                    
                    Bottom line. We should always rebuild machine standards, but import the scheduled dates.
M-C-2-   12070519 E Raw Materials Cycle Count to Create Warehouse/Bin
                    Raw Material cycle count to automatically create warehouse/bin/tag.
                    The reality is that the product was moved from its original receipt, but the warehouse clerk did 
                    not transfer the goods.  Obviously, if we use a TAG#, the cost should transfer with that tag#.
                    
                    Perhaps the best logic would be a PROMPT.   Bin location does not exist, which BIN/TAG was transf
                    erred to this new location?    This should show a list of existing Warehouse/Bins, then we could 
                    transfer the cost.
M-F-1-   10050507 E NOTES to appear at top of screen
                    When notes appear for an item, the system use to display NOTES EXIST for this Item.
                    Since we added the HISTORY button, this message is hidden.  Move to the top of the screen.

                     simultaneously updated.
                    Likewise, cycle count posing and RM warehouse posting will update the bin file, hence must update
                     the loadtag file.

                    This task works in combination with task 11040501.   When N-K-AutoIssu = Yes and the JOB# 2413 is
                     on the RM receipt, then the summarized receipt quantity must be prorated to all forms on the job
                     quantity if the RM receipt has a job number and the job is for  tandem job, which has a PO with 
                    multiple forms or a form defined as ?   Please note, a summarized receipt is a receipt with a ? o
                    n the form number.
M-U-8-   11030512 E Loadtag for ASI PO# 100404 only imports all lines with Form ?.

                    New logic for M-U-8 to allow receiving PO with Form# = ? for tandem jobs.
                    Add loadtag for PO# 100405.   This now imports all lines which is unfriendly to user which is not
                     accurate.  The problem is the one roll may actually be used for 3 PO Lines.    ie.   Each PO lin
                    e may only use .25 of a roll.   Ideally, they want to enter just the item and how many tags and h

                    number at the top of the form.   Change the logic for each item to equal the job# and form#  and 
                    Blank# for the SPC#.   Howewer, the Bar Code number will only be the Job Number and Form#.   Also
                    , change the SPC/ QC number to be the Job# and Form#.  Therefore, 3 items on the same sheet / die
                     will have identical SPC/QC numbers.
                    For example if job number is 123456-99 with two blanks on form 1 and two items on form 2.
                    The SPC# will be 123456-99-01-01, 123456-99-01-02,  123456-99-02-01and 123456-99-02-02.
                    The bar code will be 123456-99-01 and 123456-99-02.
                    Please note, the QC/SPC# is now maximized at 15 characters and will not print the entire code on 
                    the job ticket.
                    New Logic:
                    Form 1 Has 2 items
                    Form 1 / Blank 1 QC# 1063-00-01-01
                    Form 1 / Blank 2 QC# 1063-00-01-02
                    On Factory Ticket Bar Code for form 1 will read 1063-00-01- Truncating -01 or -02 from QC #
                    Form 2 Has 2 Items
                    Form 2 / Blank 1 QC# 1063-00-02-03

                     For example, if we slit 1000 sheets 50 x 100 into 50x50 and we print and die cut a 2 up die, the
                    n we will glue 4000 blanks.     If a job is started on Monday and 500 sheets are slit then posted
                    , then Tuesday another 500 sheets are slit and 50 sheets wasted, but not posted, the Printer must
                     verify that a total of ONLY good 2000 sheets (2x1000) can be entered for the printer for both pr
                    oduced and waste.    Therefore, if the plant enters 1950 produced and 150 waste on the printer, a
                     message would appear "Production/Waste of 2200 exceeds 2000 via Prior Operation.    Likewise, if
                     the diecutter produces  2000 good sheets, then the glue can only produce a total of 4000 blanks 
                    including waste.  2000 x 2 up on the die.

                    t runs the form.     The concept is to have the form automatically print when the program is runn
                    ing so that the user does not have to select a form to print.   The software will pick the form f

                    Alternatively, we could add database fields, but a new file would allow flexibility for any form.

O-B-4-   12090515 E Qty Zero to Ignore Cost = Zero
                    When Invoice Quantity is ZERO, then the post program should ignore the N-K-1 Invoice Post logical
                     value = No.    ie.  the extended cost is zero even though the cost on the item screen is > zero.

                    on to the order line number or the manually entered line number on the order.
                    If multiple orders were on an invoice, every single order may be line 1.
                    Therefore the line number sequence as the invoice printed should be posted to the invoice history
                     so that AR reprint will reprint the same sort option.

                    For additional cost,  we could copy all data required.
                    THIS WILL NOT COPY FROM SEPARATE DATABASES.    THIS WILL COPY FROM ONE COMPANY TO THE NEXT COMPAN

                    TT the MRP quantity for each real mateial.  This only has to do with committing board to a job an
                    d not ISSUES to the job.

                    erial file which would then automatically ISSUE materials when the job is closed.
