         08060336 E Meeting with JRH & YSK about scheduling
A- - -   09190305 E Error when posting data collection
                    See fax.  
A-C-1-   01070307 E Program to mark all A/R invoices paid by date range
                    Have entered 2 years of A/R invoices and need to mark all as paid.  Mark paid by date range.  Add
                     logic to select by Invoice range.   This shoud create corresponding cash payment.   Since many i
                    nvoices will need to be reopened because they actually have not been paid, add logic to reverse t
                    he payment logic.
A-C-1-   08080304 E Add pop-up message
                    Add a pop-up message if the check amount is not equal to the balance of the invoices selected.  M
                    essage should read something like this.  
                    
                    Do you want to include discounts even if past terms date?
                    
                    If answer is yes, then the line items will calculate the discount for all invoices.  If answer is
                     no then it will work the same way as it does now.
A-F- -   01090304 E Average # Days Modification
                    Move from character to GUI.
                    Need average# days to pay on the customer total screen to calculate only on the last 120days.  Ad
                    d customer modifiable field to change amount of days.  
                    
                    See task#12060203 in character
A-F- -   08210202 E Freight Cost by MSF,  Need by Sept Conversion
                    Move Character Task  04050201 to GUI
                    Current logic in common carrier/truck file only has Pallet Y/N.  Add new
                    option in the carrier file called cost per MSF next to Y/N.  The truck matrix
                    will have the quantity column read up to MSF and the cost column will read
                    Cost/MSF.  This cost will be multiplied by the MSF Freight Ratio field for the
                    Board Material on the estimate.  Likewise, a new field called MSF Freight
                    Ratio will be added to the FG Totals Screen and will be updated when creating
                    a finished goods item.  The Totals Screen, update via estimate op[tion, the
                    program will also update the FG item field called MSF Freight Ratio from the
                    estimated board Code.  For example,  200 C Flute may have a ratio of 1.00,
                    whereas 200B would be = .9, DW = 1.3 and TW = 1.7. Hence the estimate, order
                    entry and billing will base the total freight cost based on the total MSF
                    times the cost from the Carrier/Delivery Zone times the MSF Freight Ratio.
                    This requires modifying over 12 programs including estimating, order
                    processing, billing, etc.  The estimating program must be modified for single
                    item estimates, sets and two piece boxes.
                    
                    The raw material file will allow updating the Ave Weight Field when the
                    material type is "B".  Move logic to GUI Raw Material File, FG and estimating.
                    
                    Please note, if MSF Freight Ratio is blank, assume 1.0 as multiplier.
A-F-1-   03210302 E Customer File

                    ategory such as Boxes, Farm out, Tape, Supplies, etc.  We need fields.  New Field called Style wi
                    ll replace Customer Type and Item#, Product Category, Square Feet of Box will replace Quantity on
                     the matrix. Markup % will replace Discount.  UOM will be replaced by Price ON  as in Net Profit,
                     Gross Profit, Square Feet or Board.   
                    
                    The Markup percentage will replace the markup percentage in the customer file and will be used in
                     the estimate calculation.
A-Q-1-   10160314 E Copy Order Invoice Inquriy to AR Inquiry screen
                    Copy OP Invoice inquiry to AR Inquiry Menu
A-Q-2-   12170302 E Customer Activity for Paid Invoices - Age Days
                    The age days for paid invoices should be the days to pay.   Currently this shows how many days ol
                    d this invoice is to todays date, which is confussing.   If the invoice balance is 0, then the Ag
                    e days should be calculated as Last paid date minus invoice date = days to pay.
                    
                    Open Invoice balances would continue to age as it currently does.

                    For ASSEMBLED SETS, when the N-K-1 Autopost option logical value is YES, then the  component FG i
                    tems should be posted to the FG receipt record when posting production for the last operation for
                     each form.    Current logic will post the SET item when the last operation is posted for the las
                    t form.  This logic is fine for single item jobs and Unassembled jobs.  
                    
                    Please note.  the program must prompt for the unit count of the component from the finished good 
                    item file rather than the unit count for the SET item with this new logic.  
E- - -   01240301 E DB Index Estimate# as Integer for Speed ??
                    Change index from character value to integer value.  Only if this will speed up the searches.

                    This was showing item name and jeff changed to same as character, which  shows estimated descript
                    ion which is no longer needed and causes problems.
                    
                    Change to ITEM NAME in both packages.   Hence if I enter 200C or press F1 and select 200C, the it

                    imate.  The boad cost on the estimate could use a specific vendor to calculate the factory cost, 
                    however the order and job cost utilize the blank vendor cost.   The problem is that the estimate 
                    does not have a database field to retain the board vendor used on each form of an estimate.   Whe
                    n the order cost is calculated, the cost should match the estimated cost.
                    This required knowing the board vendor used on each form of an estimate.

                    Example,   1000 / .99 =  1010 blanks  + 10 MR wasted
                    
                    Printer (Sheet Fed)  Hence 1020 blanks / (2x2)  = 255 Net Sheets
                    255 / .99 =  257.57 sheets Plus 10 sheets MR waste = 267 Net Sheets
                    
                    Sliter,  Gross Sheets hence  267 / (2x2) = 66.75 Gross sheets
                    66.75 / .99 = 67.42 + 10 MR sheets = 77.42 round up to 77 Gross Sheets.
                    
                    MR Sheets are listed on routing screen.  (10 Gross + 10/4 Net + 10 / 16) = 10+2.5+.625=13.125

                    he box width first panel size.  This logic will not apply to the RC department or for GL departme

                    e the code "B" in the style file. 
                    
                    The slot length is always equal to the first panel on the width of a box style.   If this panel i
                    s greater than the maximum panel size, the automatic routing must search for another machine.
                    
                    See Estimate 928.  The Flatbed print has maximum slot of 10 inches.
                    The box is 20x20x20, hence the first panel is 10.08 , hence the total = 30.08 inches.  This shoul
                    d not import to the routing. 
E-C- -   02180309 E Sht Calc Prompt Maximize Yield using all Dimensions?
                    New Sheet Calc toggle button.     Once the SHEET CALC button is pressed, the user will enter the 
                    layout machine then press enter.    A small screen prompts for a few letters of the board or foam
                     material.   Add option for foam called.  " Maximize Yield using All Dimensions?   The box  will 
                    be unchecked as a defaut to NO.    This new logic will search for foam material without reversing
                     the dimensions to maximize the yield.  
                    
                    For example, if the finished foam lenght, width and depth were 3x10x1 = 30 out respectively.
                    Lets assume a foam sheet was  20 x 27 x 1 which would be a perfect yield of 2 x 9 x 1 if we were 
                    to maximize Yield using all dimensions.   If this flag was NO, then the maximum yield on this she
                    et would be 6 x 2 x 1 or 12 out total.   ie The system would utilize 18x20x1 because 20/3 = 6 on 
                    the Lenght,  27/10 = 2 on the width and 1/1 = 1 on the depth.    In both cases, the gross sheet s
                    ize would be used to calculate the total cost of foam.   Of course, the number out may require mo
                    re foam due to waste without maximizing the yield.

                         All estimates will also utilize Vendor Min/Max Sheet Limits?  
                    First, the corrugated and foam vendor material cost matrix will contain the minimum sheet width a
                    nd lenght and maximum sheet width and lenght.   Since these fields do not exist, we will use the 
                    Valid Roll Width Fields since they are not used for corrugated esimating.  The last four array fi
                    elds will be called Vendor Min Width, Max Width, Min Lenght, Max Lenght
                    
                    When selecting the best vendor price and/or limits, the calculation button will select the vendor
                     with the best price for each estimated quantity based on the estimated cost matrix unit of measu
                    re (i.e. MSF).   The estimated quantity will include the waste quantity as it currently does.    
                    The sheet size on the layout folder must fit within the minimun and maximum sheet limits for the 
                    vendor with the best price.   The vendor selected will appear on the estimate detail on the hardc
                    opy print out.
                    
                    For sets, each form will be processed with the same calcualtion, hence different Vendors may be s
                    elected on different forms for the same estimate quantity.
                    Please note,  This logic will have no effect on the job creation logic, which currently uses the 
                    blank vendors cost matrix for the job material cost.

                     next largest cylinder size as the Net Sheet size Length for board cost calculation.
                    
                    On the Layout folder, an F1 on the Front to Back dimension (Cylinder Diameter) would allow the se
                    lection of a specific cylinder for use in calculating the number on the die and thus the sheet si
                    ze.
                    
                    The roll width field would automatically default to YES whenever the layout machine was a roll fe

E-F- -   10010311 E Layout Folder for Web Fed w/Real Roll should import Cylinder
                    See Estimate 1608.  The Web Fed / Roll Fed printing press should use the cylinder  size from the 
                    machine file when using a real roll material.   Stocked sheets would not be allowed on a web fed 
                    press, hence this additional logic would only apply to stock rolls.    The length of a stock roll
                     would still import the cylinder size.

                    o determine the run speed.  Also, only the 1st item would have make ready standards.
                    
                    For sheeting, if the sheets/forms are identical, then the run speeds would be based on the accumu

                    For die cutting, if the sheets use the same styles and blanks, die size and sheet size, then the 
                    run speeds would search the total sheets for all forms.  Make ready would only apply to the 1st m

                    For printig, if the sheets use the same styles and blanks, die size and sheet size, then the run

                    ype Field called "A" for Auto Distribution.   For example.  an acccount number 5000-000 would be 
                    set up as an Phone Expense Account.  This number would be defined in the vendor file for the phon
                    e company.  In the chart of accounts for the account number 5000-000 there would be two new accou
                    nt numbers 50000-100 Phone Expense Box Division and 5000-200 Phone Expense Display Division along
                     with the percentage distribution.   
                    
                    For examplay, when adding a vendor invoice for the phone company, the account 5000-000 would impo
                    rt to the A/P invoice screen.  When posting the invoice to the general ledger, the dollar amount 
                    assigned to the account number would 5000-000.  At the end of the month, this dollar amount  woul
                    d be distributed to accounts 5000-100 and 5000-2000 based on the percentage defined in the GL cha
                    rt of accounts file.  Hence account 5000-000 would be debited and accounts 5000-100 and 5000-200 
                    would be credited.

                     be enabled in order to change the date.   This field will print on the report.

                    t and quantity fields.  This button needs to be on both Folding and Corrugated material, and also
                     must be secured by a password.
M-F-1-   01210309 E If the Vendor Matrix exists then Print Board Cost rather than Liner an
                    If the Vendor Matrix exists then Print Board Cost rather than Liner and Medium.
                    When the Board Material has the Cost matrix defined plus is using the BOM for liner and medium.  
                    If the user builds the boards cost matrix such as the matrix of 200C, then the BOM will not print
                     Liner/Medium/Liner combinations on the estimate print out.
                    The estimate would print out exactly like a corrugated sheet plant estimate.     If the cost matr
                    ix is blank, the the current logic of printing the liner and medium combination will print.
                    
                    In either scenario, the job file will be create with the BOM liner and medium combination.  This 
                    is the actual material that will be used on the job.    Normally corrugated plants will autopost 
                    this material when the job closes or when the finished goods are received.

                     Default to Paper.   Print report in Summary or Detail verson.
                    Summary will accumulate all tags.  Detail will print by Tag#.   Report will print grand totals.
                    
                    Item Code,   Item Descripiton, Tag#,   Lineal Feet      MSF       Weight    Cost Value.
M-R- -   12120210 E New Roll UOM for RM and Purchase Orders
                    New Logic for Corrugated Materials for "P"aper Material.
                    
                    In network administration, system reference files, units of measure, we added a new UOM called Ro
                    ll.   The UOM file in system administration reference files will house the default lineal feet pe
                    r roll.   ie 18,000.    In the raw material file, the material type equal to "P"aper will now use
                     the Length as the average lineal feet per roll to calculate the on order quantity during purchas
                    ing.  
                    
                    During purchasing, the Paper Rolls will be ordered with the UOM as ROLL but consumed by the linea
                    l feet.   For example, when adding a purchase order for 10 rolls, the program will multiply the n
                    umber of rolls times the length in the raw material file lineal feet to calculate the total on or
                    der quantity in the raw materials file. If the raw material file is blank, then the system admin 
                    UOM will be used. 
                    
                    Hence, if we order 10 rolls of  26#M-80" the program would place 200,0000 lineal feet on order in
                     the item file for 26#M-80". 
                    
                    When receiving the PO in raw materials receipts, the user will enter each rolls lineal feet by ta
                    g number.  Each tag could be more or less than the 20,000, hence would reduce the on order quanti
                    ty and update the on hand quantity.    The purchase order receipt quantity must be updated as rol

M-U-1-   02140306 E RM Receipt Auto Popup for Sets
                    Add Raw Material Receipts for PO  163 for Job 809, which has multiple 200 C line items for differ
                    ent forms.  Evoke the same logic as F1 on the S/B program when the user tabs to the S/B field.   
                    If only one PO#, Job# and Item Code exists on the purchase order, then the system will not displa
                    y a popup, hence will import the data as it currently does without displaying the popup.
                    
                    Currently, the program defaults to 1-1 for the Sheet/Blank.   If the user press F1 on the PO# or 
                    F1 on the item code or presses F1 on the S/B fields currently, the user may select the correct pa
                    rt number to receive.    
                    
                    This new logic would automatically popup the S/B selections when the same PO#, Same Job# and same
                     Raw Mateiral Item Code exists on the PO.     Hence if a job for a set uses the same board code s
                    uch as 200 C, the program will popup the selection list.

                    NEW system control parameters:
                    POEXPORT.  Change the character value to ALLIANCE and set logical value to  YES.
                    ALLIANCE.  Enter the disk drive name and folder for output of the file to reside.   
                    
                    Alliance will need to know where to pick up the file from your server.
                    
                    New POExport logic for Alliance Scheduling Software.  Character value will be CORRTRIM or ALLIANC
                    E.  This logic will be similar to CorrTrim scheduling integration, but with the file format as de
                    fined by Alliance.
                    
                    Modification will be billed to both Sutherland and Century Packaging.  Since each client may have
                     unique PO print formats, we need new control parameter for downloading purchase orders for board
                    .  Format on Email but modified to include more pertinent information.
                    
                    
                    $1000 billed to Century,  $1000 Billed to Sutherland
N-K-1-   01150314 E N-K AUTOISSUE to not Issue Real Materials
                    When N-K-Autoissue is set to YES, the receipt and issue is posted immediately to save our sheet p
                    lants the time to do two transactions.   Hence it is in and out with the same transaction.   If y
                    ou turn this off, then estimated materials will not post to the job.   This will be the current l
                    ogic.  Saves lots of time, but you loose inventory control.    
                    
                    NEW logical value option called  NO.
                    New option to issue only estimated, but force you to issue stocked real mateial a a separate step
                    .    Therefore, estimated materials received with Job number will be immediately issued to the jo
                    b.   Materials that are stocked (item code is "R")  in the raw material file will not automatical
                    ly create an ISSUE transaction.
                    
                    Thus, when the board is received for real material for a job,  the receipt will post, but the use
                    r must create an ISSUE transaction for the actual material used on the job.  
N-K-1-   01170306 E N-K CUSTSIZE  F3 not working
                    F3 Not working.   Update shows error.  Move help below to F3.
                    New N-K-1 Control Parameter called CUSTSIZE.  The interger value must be either 8 or 6 characters
                    .   Default to 8.  When integer value is 6, then the new customer must be total of 6 characters. 
                     If user enters 6 characters, system will promtp. must enter 6 characters and return to the custo
                    mer code.
                    
                    To add TEMP, change interger value to zero.  Add TEMP, when change back to customer size required
                     up to 8 characters.
N-K-1-   01310303 E N-K FOAMCOST   Board Cost by Sheet Size
                    N-K-FOAMCOST.  New option to cost board by the sheet size rather than the blank size.   Current l
                    ogic assumes the remainder of the foam material will be returned to inventory for use with other 
                    jobs.  Hence the logic uses the blank dimensions / 144 x the price per BF.   Add option to called
                      FOAMCOST.   Current logic should beBLANK.  New option would be SHEET.   When option is SHEET, t
                    he cost will be the LXWXD of the sheet /144 times Price/BF times number of sheets including waste
                    .  Add prompt on Calculate button to default to BLANK or SHEET, but allow each estimate to calcul
                    ate either way.
                    
                    This would provide the ability to charge for the entire sheet or bin or just for the blank square
                     footage.
                    
                    
                    
N-K-1-   02030304 E N-K TIME OUT  -  CORRUPTION ERROR MESSAGE
                    Need a new time out message for clients that do not pay their bill.   I do not want the message t
                    o say time out.     I want the message to save.    *** PROCEDURE WAS TERMINATED ABNORMALLY.  DATA
                     CORRUPTION HAS INTERRUPTED THE PROCESS, PLEASE CALL YOUR SOFTWARE VENDOR **** (0331)
                    The error message should display the time out date, hence 0331 would be set in the system as Marc
                    h 31, 2003.  Do not include the year.
                    
                    STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
                    
                    1) Rename F:\RCODE\FIXEXDAT.r to  FIXEXDAT
                    2) Login as asi, yorkie   Change date to time out date
                    3) Rename file back to FIXEXDAT.r
                    
                    
                    Only asi can change the time out date.  
N-K-1-   02100319 E N-K QUOPRICE to use Interger and Decimal Value
                    Move logic for QUOPRINT character value equal to FIBRE to the QUOPRICE integer value and decimal 
                    value.
                    
                    QUOPRICE logical value will import the sell price when logical value is YES.
                    When the QUOPRINT character value is FIBRE, the sell price cannot be modified
                    based on a previous modification.  Also, this logic forced the quote to have
                    been created.
                    
                    Add new logic to utilize the integer value to override the sell price rather
                    than use the FIBRE character value.   Also, utilize the decimal value to force
                    the quote.  If the Interger value is 0, then the sell price may be modified.

-------- -------- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    If the decimal value is 0, then the quote is not required to enter an order.
                    If the value are 1, then the price cannot be modified and the order will not
                    be created if a quote is not created for that quantity.
N-K-1-   02130306 E N-K OEAUTOPO for Foam
                    Similar logic to automatic create PO for Board, but add PO for foam.   The price is per BF, but t
                    he system must calculate the total number of FOAM Each gross sheets.  When creating the PO line i
                    tem, the total number of foam sheets must be calculated.  Currently the total number of BF is imp
                    orted into the PO, but this must be changed to the total number of EA.   Same logic must be chang
                    ed when adding a PO for foam directly via the PO module..
                    
                    We must add the Depth Field to the Order Popup screen and recalcalate the MRP quantity in the job
                     file to yield the total sheets rather than the BF as originally designed.
N-K-1-   02240308 E N-K POPRINT = XPRINT
                    1)  If Logical Value is YES, then print Company Heading identical to INVPRINT logic so that compa
                    ny prints from the customer with type = X.     
                    
                    2) Blank information should print either decimals or 16th's.    Corrugated Materials should print
                     in 16th's,   Folding Materials should print in decimals.    For example 28 1/2 x 40 1/4 should p
                    rint as 28.5 x 40.25 for folding materials and 28.08 x 40.04 for corrugated materials.
                    
                    3)  Cant override the cost / MSF.
                    
                    4) When overriding the cost per MSF, the cost with setup does not change on the print out.
                    SeeSample.
                    
                    5)  Change GST on Bottom to Tax.
N-K-1-   03060311 E N-K CHKFMT = UNIPAK
                    New A/P laser check format per Unipak Sample .  (Check, stub, stub.)  See original sample.
                    This will print on a HP Laserjet.
N-K-1-   03110305 E N-K LOGOCOLOR = MORGAN
                    New Control Value called LOGOCOLR.  This field will change the XPRINT forms for the customer type
                     X.   The customer type X in the customer file is currently used for the company name and address
                     for all XPRINT formats when the logical value is YES.   This option will change the color of the
                     company name and address to black or red.   This will do all forms including:
                    
                    AR Invoice,
                    OE Invocie,

                    CHANGE the character value to RED or BLACK
N-K-1-   03120306 E N-K FGPOST (Allitems) Post FG and Invoice Post to Asset Account
                    This original Southpak mod is not working at Pacific Pkg.
                    N-K-FGPOSTGL.   Move logic from character to GUI for Purchased FG Items.  New logic to post FG fo
                    r jobs exactly like purchased FG.    This would prevent posting jobs via the J-W or WIP posting o
                    f Jobs.  
                    
                    New character value field called ALLITEMS logic to take Job Cost WIP logic and move to FG post fo
                    r both jobs and purchased items without jobs.  FG receipts for Jobs would post a debit to FG Mate
                    rial, DL, FO and VO.  and Credit WIP material, DL, FO, VO from from the Job Cost Product Line Fil
                    e.  Purchased Finished Goods would continue to debit  the FG Material, as an ASSET account  and c
                    redtit WIP Material which is defined as a liability account such as Accrued A/P credit.  Purchase
                    d Finished goods will reverse the accrued account when the A/P invoice is posted.   
                    
                    When character value is  POONLY, the current logic as the logical value is YES would be used.    
                    FG receipts for jobs must be posted via J-WIP transfers in job costing, which  would post jobs vi
                    a the job cost software, but continue to post purchased FINISHED GOODS to the ASSEST and A/P Accr
                    ued Account.
                    
                    INVPOST.  New character values as above.  POONLY would post a credit to finished goods and a cred
                    it to the cost of goods sold account when posting invoices for purchased finished goods.    ALLIT
                    EMS would also post Jobs as credit to FG Material, DL, FO,VO and debit COGS Material, DL, FO, VO.

                    n the commission percentage would default to zero (0) on the CALCULATE button via the PRINT folde
                    r.  The commission may show 5% on the SPEC folder, but this would not be used in the calculation.
                    
                    
                    Default flag to YES.
N-K-1-   04100307 E N-K SETPRINT.  Logical Value to Default Assembled / Unassembled.
                    N-K-1 SETPRINT.  Logical value to create FG as assembled or unassbled depending on logical value.
                      Should also work in estimating when creating FG items sets in estimate.
                    
                    Set the logical value to NO and all sets will be created as ASSEMBLED sets.

N-K-1-   09090312 E N-K ADDRelease = Bin/Tag logic to ship existing overrun inventory
                    New Addrelease character flag called BIN/TAG.    When the character value is Bin/Tag, this new re
                    lease logic will create releases from older jobs overrun inventory will be invoked.   This logic 
                    will be added to the order inquiry and order entry release buttons program when creating an actua
                    l release.  Essentially, the release button is building the actual release, then allowing the cus
                    tomer service rep to select the actual bin / tag numbers for previous jobs to ship on the new rel

                    Character value % will be current logic.  Character value = $/Pallet will be new logic.
                    The decimal value will represent a dollar charge per pallet per month.  For example, $3.20 per pa
                    llet.  Each estimate quantity must calculate the cost based on the number of pallets per month re
                    maining in the warehouse.   
                    For example,  the estimate unit count is 500 boxes per pallet.  If the estimate quantity is 10,00
                    0, then this is 20 pallets.  First assumption is that first month has one delivery, hence no pall
                    ets.  Assume the take per month is 2500 and the warehouse months are 4.
                    Hence the first month will have 15 pallets, the second month will have 10 pallets,  3rd month wil
                    l have 5.    Total warehouse cost will be 30 pallets times $3.20 = $160 dollars.  This will be di
                    vided by each estimate quantity and multiplied by 1000 to yield the cost per thousand.     
                    Also need  Handling Charge per Pallet.   This cost is Total Pallets x Cost per Pallet of $4.

O-B-3-   12310205 E Fax Invoices in a Batch
                    New option to fax a range of invoices with numerous customers.  This will utilize the microsoft i
                    nternet explorer fax software available with windows XP or windows 2000.   When printing invoices
                     via the hot keys O-B-3 invoice printing, an option call FAX and another option called EMAIL will
                     display.  When selecting either option, the program will print a hard copy then sort all invoice
                    s by customer.   Each batch of invoices per customer will become an attachment for emails or a ba
                    tch of faxes for each customer.
                    
                    All customers fax numbers and email address must be defined in the customer file.  There is an ic
                    on at the top of the customer file that looks like book tabs and displays phone info when the cur
                    sur is postitioned on this icon.  Add as many contact names and fax / email numbers as required. 
                     The title must show either FAX or EMAIL for this to be a valid fax or email address.

O-B-5-   10240307 E Release Status Z and C should be reversed.
                    Change the Invoiced status to be "C" and change the unposted invoice to be "Z".    Our clients ar
                    e use to "C" for completed and the invoices are printed and posted within minutes normally, so th
                    e "Z" code should be the odd ball status code.     Leave the field names on the O-R-2 and O-R-9 a
                    nd O-R-12 the same, but Invoice would now be a "Z" and Completed would stay  "C".
                    
                    Hence Z will mean invoice is not posted.
O-B-6-   04020326 E Commision Report Download to Excell
                    B-R-6 Commission Report.    New option to Download to Excell.   This would output the results of

                    2) click the INVOICE  Folder.   There should be a folder called BILL OF LADING.
                    This should show the details of the bill of lading just like the character version.
O-Q-1-   05270308 E Order Inquiry View Item  Add Order Qty

                    rder number as the first field, but we need the order number as the first field with our new brow
                    ser.
O-Q-1-   06060303 E Add Qty Shipped to Browser
                    Add Qty Shipped to right of the Order Qty.  This was on the character version.
O-Q-1-   09090311 E Add release by number of Pallets
                    New logic to add a release by number of pallets.  When S-8-ADDRELSE char val = "ByPallet", the nu
                    mber of pallets entered will search the pallet count from the finished goods item's bin file and 
                    multiply the pallet count by the number of pallets to calculate the release quantity.    
                    
                    This logic will be moved to the order entry release screeen and the order inquiry screen.
                    The same logic will also be added to both the RELEASE button and the BOL button in both programs.
O-Q-1-   12100306 E Order Inquiry to show item one time.  Enter displays history

                    sales history for that item to that customer should display.
                    
                    This should work the same way in order entry under, HISTORY at bottom.
O-R-1-2  09240313 E New Monthly Sales Value Status Report
                    This report will include invoiced line items as well as completed releases that have not been inv
                    oiced.   New Status for posted invoices equal to "Z" equals completed and invoiced.   The existin
                    g status of "C" would be defined as completed shipment, but invoice not yet posted.
                    
                    Change O-R-12 toggle box for Invoiced Releases.  (i.e. Status = "Z")
                    
                    The commission report and/or the Sale Analysis (H-6) is useful in determining the amounts invoice
                    d.   In trying to determine what has been released for the month and the sales value we have foun
                    d Scheduled releases (O-R-12) to be close except for the completed releases portion. If the order
                     has not been closed, for example still has pending future releases, the value for these orders w
                    ill appear on both the commission report/H-6 report and the scheduled release report.  If we coul
                    d create a separate code for completed releases and invoiced releases and provided a filter on th
                    e O-R-12 report for example we would be able to identify a value for items which are to be produc
                    ed but not yet invoiced more reliably.
                    
                    
                    
O-R-2-   07240305 E Release Report to print Order Line Status
                    Print the order line status code such as RUSH, NB4, HOLD, ASAP, etc as the last column on the rep

                    New Option:  Calculate Commission on Board Cost Only? Y/N.  NO, will work as
                    the report currently does.  YES, will calculate the cost for each invoice
                    shipped via a Job based on the Job's Board Material Standard Cost/M times the
                    quantity shipped.  Please note, for sets, this will require adding multiple
                    form/board materials.  When multiple sheets are used on a job, each board is
                    written to the job material file, hence only one board material will be used
                    per form. For farm outs or supplies, the cost will come directly from the cost
                    defined in the bin location file that was shipped from the bill of lading.
                    
                    This will do nothing for Farm Out Finished Goods per Joe 1-17-02.

                    1) F1 on customer does not show any customers.
                    
                    2) Add order 1007 and answer NO to import all items.   Cant get past PO#.  The character version 
                    allows entering a new PO, then creates the order release when the release is posted.
                    I think the scheduled release should be created when the SAVE button is entered.  
                    
                    4)  The last field  S/B should default to B both ship and Bill

                         Then the BOL cannot be posted either.
                    
                    6) If I answer YES to import all items the system works perfectly, except I cannot change the

O-U-1-   06100315 E Sets not building costs for components
                    See item Michelob Set.  The cost is zero, because the components costs are zero.
                    Thus, when I receive the set, the cost on the FG item is zero.
                    
                    Please note, older jobs must have standards recalculated for this to work.   New jobs will proper

O-U-1-   09250302 E Security Option to Add FG items with Estimate#
                    When adding an finished goods part number that does not exist, the program immediately prompts to
                     create the FG item.  When the estimate# is blank,  prompt for a security code that is defined in
                     the N-K-1 SECURITY character value. 
                    
                    Once the user enters the correct security code, the window to create the FG item will appear.  If
                     the security is wrong, then the item will not be created and the cursur will return to the previ
                    ous order entry step.

                    for a new order from an existing tandem estimate.   The cursor should move directly to the custom

                    Please note, many clients like Fibre will want to use this feature, but will not want to have a p
                    rompt for every corrugated order.   The button will be a friendlier method.
                    
                    With the button, I believe we can eliminate the N-K-1 OETANDEM option.   We have to many switches
                     already, so eliminate this one after the button is added.

O-U-5-   02240311 E JOBCARDC = XPRINT dropping scoring
                    JobcardC = Xprint.  Portrait verion is not printing the zero on a number such as 16.10
                    See Sample
                    
                    Solution:
                    Estimate had 0 missing. I just rebuilt all values and print fine.
                    This could be a bug in estimating.   How can the estimate create a dimension as .00.
                    This is probably an Add mode problem.   Could be converted data bug?
O-U-5-   04020311 E Xprint Job Ticket
                    Xprint Portrait and Landscape Job Ticket X to print shipto from order entry file. 
                    Currently, the job ticket prints the ship to from the estimate shipto.   This is good for jobs wi
                    thout order numbers.   Jobs with order numbers should print the shipto for the first shipto code 
                    in the release file.     Since there may be many shiptos on the release screen.  Print the first 
                    shipt for that job with the earliest release date for each line item on the order. 
                    
                    Multiple jobs could be on a single customer order so the job number must search the order line th
                    at matches that job number.

                    Currently the job ticket for Xprint print the Board PO# from the customer order entry line item.
                    The reality is that each form on a set  could be ordered with a different purchase order number ,
                     hence only the first form would print the correct board PO#.

                    form number listed on the purchase order.

                    are selected, only the components will create the load tag file.
                    
                    The screen will prompt for each component on the set.  This will populate the
                    total quantity needed based on the order quantity times the qty/set from the

                    quantity required divided by the unit count would equal the total load tags.
                    Lastly, the number of tags per pallet in the customer file would be multiplied
                    by the calculated tags.

                    1200 sheets - 1100 allowable would equal 100 Over Pieces.

                    The job file standards create properly shows the combined cost and creates the proper PO cost on 
                    PO# 211.  Please note the job file always uses the blank vendor cost matrix. 
                    
                     I add PO# 212 manually and the cost imports at $40 which is the cost of a  single estimate.  The
                     combined cost would be $30.  
P-U-1-   04030301 E New UOM called LOT for Misc Materials
                    New unit of measure called LOT for the purchased cost UOM for miscellaneous raw materials.   This
                     will allow materials such as litho lables to be ordered as 5000 EA with a cost of $1000 per LOT.
                       This will require the similar logic to be moved to the raw material receipt and posting progra
                    m as well as to the accounts payable invoicing and A/P posting.
                    
                    Upon RM receipts, the quantity may be 5500, but the cost per EA must be converted based on the $1
                    000 per LOT.  ie $1000/5500 = .1818 EA .  They should be able to enter $1,000 per LOT and the pro
                    gram would convert to cost EA.   The Stock UOM should be EA or M.
                    Regardless of the number of units purchased, received or invoiced, the total cost would be the LO
                    T cost.   The consumption / stocking unit of measure would be EA, therefore the cost per each wou
                    ld be recalculated based on the LOT cost divided by the actual quantity recieved or invoiced. 
                    
                    Likewise, the AP invoice would import the Cost of $1000 per LOT, but must calculate the cost per 
                    each based on the quantity received.

                    he number of pieces run. This mod is the reason I also asked about the completed question in the 
                    setup, run and cleanup screens the operator is not always sure if his run is the completed quanti
                    ty which was being addressed by the mod showing the quantities.
                    
                    I think we should show the job quantity and Completed Qty on the Touch Screen.

V-U-1-   02270301 E AP invoice for just 1 receipt does not need popup
                    If only one raw material receipt exists, simply default the quantity to the AP invoice line witho
                    ut a popup by receipt.
                    
                    Add AP invoice for Inland for PO 76. The Popup by Receipt still shows.
                    This is for item 200C50x100 which has just one receipt.
                    When I enter PO 76 and press Tab, the invoice should immediately import the receipt quantity and 
                    save the line item.
