                    GS&A Override Screen.
                    Must be added to all four estimate types for both Corrugated and Folding.

                    They will enter percentage that will be saved for this estimate if recalculated.
                    The percentage will be multiplied by TOTAL FACTORY COST, exactly as warehousing percentage is cal
                    culated.  The Markup Percentage will print below warehousing.
                    Hence, if warehouse percentage is 10% and Markup% is 10%, they will be same dollar value.
                    Estimate will show Factory Markup.
                    This will add to FULL Cost and is used in Margin, Commision and Sell Price Calculation.
                    All estimate types.
                    CHANGES:
                    2) USE TWO DIFFERENT NAMES FOR THIS NEW FIELD AS FOLLOWS:
                    	A) FOLDING ESTIMATES USE - FOLD %
                    	B) CORRUGATED ESTIMATES USE - BROKER %
                    3) DEFAULT AS FOLLOWS WITH OPTION TO REMOVE OR CHANGE IF NECESSARY:
                    	A) FOLDING ESTIMATES DEFAULT TO 5%
                    	B) CORRUGATED ESTIMATES DEFAULT TO 0
                       ESP - Added two new default fields to Cost Estimate Control.
                    
                    
E- - -   01190701 E COPY Button on MISC folder
                    Add new COPY button for both Folding & Corrugated estimating.  The copy feature on this miscellan
                    eous page would allow copy of a Misc / Subcontract cost to many forms for tandem, sets and combo 
                    estimates.  This would work similar to the COPY FILM button on the layout screen.
E- - -   03110903 E Commission Calculation (Additional Hrs @ $100/Hr per Task 08250811)
                    See Attached.  (Similar to Task  03030910 )
                    Estimate was calculated twice.  
                    The first calculation shows a commission of 4% sell price $44,266.  
                    The second calculation price was changed to on the item screen .
                    The total selling price for the estimate goes to a sell price of $44,268 and the commission goes 
                    down to 3.8%.  
                    How is that possible?  
                    Since the sell price is now a couple $$ higher, the commission should stay the same or increase s
                    lightly.

E- - -   06040922 E Do not create FG with category of "D"isplay
                    They had a mod done a while back (Jeff did the Mod) where when they have the catgeory of "DSPLC" 
                    they had wanted the FG to get created with the first character being a "D".  They no-longer want 
                    that to use a "D".
                    This should go back to using a "C" for Corrugated and a "F" for folding even though the category 
                    is DSPLC. 
                    This just needs to be commented out of the code.
E- - -   06210702 E Customer code should not be updated if Order Number Exists
                    Esitmate with order numbers should not allow changing the customer code in both estimating.

                    d.  This will search all items begining with the characters entered.  To do an exact search remov
                    e the (*) this will search only those items matching the characters entered.  Entering an asteris
                    k before the characters will search any items that have those characters entered anywhere in the 
                    field.

E- - -   08120912 E Prep and Die file to round up to nearest $5.00 CEPREP FiveDollar
                    Add Char Value FiveDollar to N-K-1 CEPREP to round to the nearest $5.00 increment.
                    When calculating an estimate and in order entry (will show in o/e if separate charge ) 
                    if the prep file calculates to 
                    $80.01 show $85.00
                    $82.00 show $85.00
                    $86.00 show $90.00.
                    FiveDollar option has to work both in folding and corrugated estimates and should work for any SI
                    MON value.  Similar logic to how CEPREP works now in corrugated.

                    This imports from the Machine File Matrix for the RUN crew.
                    The MR and RUN crew size is multiplied by the Direct Labor Cost in the Machine File to calculate 
                    the estimate cost.

                    Add Comm% to the Whatif Browser to all estimating options.
                    The Gross% will be replaced to show the Commission % that was calculated.
                    Whatif button will disable the commission so it can't be changed.  
                    This will only work for margin commissions that Fibre runs.

E- - -   08310908 E Rounding to nearest $5. Should not round the cost.  **INV**
                    The cost that is being entered should not round.  This should take the cost they enter, times the
                     markup if there is one and get a total.  The total should round to the nearest $5.00.
                    Material and Labor should show Amount * Qty not rounded.

E- - -   09060701 E Adding Corrugated and Folding estimate, F1 on Customer Code
                    When adding an item or new estimate, press F1 on the customer code.
                    Add new column "salesman name" to the customer lookup browser.
                    This will work when adding new estimate or add button for adding new form or blank.  They would l
                    ike the salesman name added after the customer name.

E- - -   09250903 E PRINT Folder - Item Button to use arrow down to change price

                    the next.  
                    (This should work similarly to how we can change the FG file history screen)
                    Problem is now if they have 20 items on an estimate, and they need  to change the prices individu
                    ally, they have to do an update save, then arrow down or click on the next item. 
                    
                    Had to make a separate button which launches a separate screen. Progress does not allow you do it

                    s to RED.  This would need to be changed on the Browser, Estimate and Specs folders.

E- - -   10250701 E N-K CeRunF and N-K CeRunC = Fibre to Print Avail Margin $ After Sell P
                    See the attached PDF  (Add new Row on Report if needed call Margin Cost)
                    Margin Cost will not include Commission.
                    They want Whatif Calculation to be: 
                    Sell Price = Full Cost without Commission / (1-Margin/100)
                    Also, add/move Available Margin & Percent before sell price.
                    Available Margin dollars = Sell Price - Full Cost - Commission
                    For Example.
                    Full Cost less commission = $460. Assume 40% margin finds 4% commission.
                    If they want 40% margin then Sell Price is $ 766.6666
                    Full Cost w/o Coomm is $460, Commission = $ 262, Net Profit = $2,360.
                    The What If analysis, change the Margin and recalculate a new sales price.  Likewise, if they ent
                    er a sales price, the system will subtract Margin Cost to equal Margin Dollars.  
                    Margin Dollars / Sell Price = Margin Percent which finds Commmission Percent.
                    Therefore on  What If screen, changing margin should change sell price and Net %. Changing Sell P
                    rice should change Net% and Margin %.

                    First, if FLAT COMM% in customer file is greater than 0, then that is the Specs commission %.
                    Second, if FLAT COMM% = zero, then the Customer Markup = Margin on the Matrix. 
                    The program will find the available margin percentage in the salesman matrix and transfer the com

                    The only dimensions that I can enter are .01 to .15 for 16ths.
                    Demimals are needed for folding estimates.   The estimate type on the prep file should dictate th
                    e decimal display.   Folding should always be in decimals.
                    Corrugated should be either 16th's or 32nd's depending on CECScreen.

                    The machine file reverses the labels for blank fed equipment.
                    Stop reversing the lables for now. In both folding and corrugated industry, the gluer runs throug
                    h the machine the same way as the sheet fed machines.  They have an estimate blank size of 10.08 
                    x 35.06.
                    
                    The machine routing looks at the 1st top machine dimension which is set to 11 however the label s
                    hows side by side.  If this showed front to back this would be perfect.

E-B-1-   02170605 E New Preventative Maint / Part File for Reordering Parts
                    New File to work off of the Machine Code to track all machine parts and supplies for this machine
                    .  The purpose of the modifcation is to project the reording of parts that have projected life ti
                    mes.  For example motors and belts wear out, but the key is to have the parts available to repair
                     the machine to minimize downtime.  The new file will tie directly with the raw materials file to
                     utilize reorder levels.  There are no need to duplicate fields already in the raw materials file
                    :  The new file will have the following fields.
                    Machine Code, Raw Material (RM) Part Code, RM Part Description 1, RM Part Description 2, Model#, 
                    Serial#, Date Purchased,  Date Installed, Company Installed, Person Installed, Total Impressions

E-B-1-   02260707 E Style File, SCORES button new From Flute to Flute Option
                    Current logic copyies all flutes from one style to another style. This now copies scores from one
                     style to another style. Currently, if the user selects *, this will copy to all styles.
                    
                    New Option in the style file to copy from Flute to Flute. 
                    New option called From Style = SAME and To Style = SAME.
                    This will only copy all styles but only From Flute to Flute within each Style.
                    Score allowances for DW will be copied to AB from RSC to RSC and 
                    Score allowances for DW will be copied to AB from HSC to HSC and 
                    Score allowances for DW will be copied to AB from FOL to FOL.
                    Meaning, this will not copy to other styles.
                    
                    They have score allowances defined for DW for all styles.  This new option would allow to copy sc
                    ore allowance from flutes such as EC,BC,AB, AC ect.
                    They don't want to have to go into each style and add the scoring for each style and each flute.

                    We do something similar to this for dies and plates, where we update the number of impressions on
                     a die.  (See Old Task# 01250703).  This old task looks for a die number or plate number.

                    X gsm/1000 x 2.205 x 92.9 = Y lb (per msf)
                    X= value in grams per square meter (gsm)
                    Y = value in lbs. (nominal basis weight)
                    2.205 lbs. = 1 kg.
                    92.9 square meters = 1 msf

                    Add an 8th line to the BOM screen called starch.  Pull in the starch cost per MSF and multiply it
                     by the blank size.    Add a column to the estimate tab screen called starch.  Default it to R fo

                    All the items housed in the master estimate will have identical die number, style, length, width 
                    and depth dimensions.  Essentially, the only difference is the print copy of each box. The master
                    estimate will have the unique inks for each item as well as normal machine routing and sell price                    e. 
                    The new button called NEW BUTTON called ADD TANDEM will allow creating an estimate or an order by
                    simply picking the items from the master estimate.
                    During order entry, the program will automatically create a new estimate and new job by just 
	            adding the new order.
                    For example, the master estimate may have 50 items that are the same box, but the print copy chan
                    ges.   The customer may give you a different job to produce each week.  The items required and qu
                    antity will change from order to order.
                    The customer service representative does everything.
                    Adds the customer, selects the MASTER estimate, picks the part numbers from the master estimate a
                    nd adjusts quantities.   The system, then creates a new estimate for just the selected items, add
                    s the order and creates the job in just a few minutes.

E-C- -   03020904 E Sets to Cost Ink per Form based on Total Lbs of All Forms
                    Add new Toggle Box.   Find Ink cost for all Forms?  Yes will be new logic.
                    Set estimate to calculate the ink cost (Same Ink Code) based on all forms.  
                    Therefore, the cost imported from the VEND COST matrix must be for the total pounds for all forms
                    .   Once the system finds the correct cost, then the cost will be used to calculate cost of ink f
                    or each form.
                    For example, ASI Estimate 7033 has 4 forms.  
                    Each form uses GCMI black 90.
                    Form 1 uses 2.36 pounds,  Form 2 uses .64 lbs, Form 3 uses .92 lbs, and Form 4 uses 2.80 lbs.
                    Total lbs for the set is 6.72 lbs.   
                    The VEND COST matrix would import the cost of $7 for up to 10 lbs instead of the cost of $10 for 
                    up to 3 lbs.  
                    Combo and tandem estimates currently calculate total ink used (same ink code) over multiple forms
                     and then spread the ink cost back in to the individual forms based on percentage of total ink us
                    ed?  
                    Please note, the calculation for total pounds of each form will remain the same, however the cost
                     will depend on the toggle box setting.

E-C- -   04200911 E ADDER Cost to use ADDER Vend Cost Matrix based on Total Board MSF.
                    Board on forms 1 and 2 when adding total quantity together would push the total quantity to the n
                    ext board cost level, which would lower the cost.
                    There are 3 forms on these estimates but only 2 forms require the adder cost.  
                    The estimates are basically the same I just switched the order of the Forms 2&3:
                            - V5 Est 120106 adders are on Form 1 & 3
                            - V5 Est 120107 adders are on Form 1 & 2
                    The problem is that on the first Est 120106, the cost for the adder should be lower, however the 
                    culmulative quantity of board in not being calculated as it is ignoring form 3.
                    
                    Joes Note 050409 created estimates on V10 for Eric.
                    Calculate estimates with STONE as vendor and see OW Vend Cost Matrix.
                    Up to 25MSF is $10, Up to 50 MSF is $7.50, Up to 100 is $5MSF and Up to 99999 is $2.50 MSF.
                    Estimate 7080 has OW on just 1 form and OW cost is $10 / MSF as this is appox 20 MSF.
                    Estimate 7081 has OW on all 4 forms, so cost should be $5 MSF as total board is 80 MSF.
                      This also imports as $10 MSF.
                    Estimate 7082 has OW on Forms 1 & 3, so cost should be $7.5  MSF as total board for just two form
                    s would be approx.  40 MSF.  This still shows $10 per MSF.
                    
                    This is really a mod, but I think our logic should have been done years ago.
                    See estimate 7080, 7081 and 7082.
                    The cost for OW is $10 per MSF no matter how many forms.
                    The adder charges should work similar to board.
                    However the total MSF for Adders must calculate the total board for only the forms that use OW.  
                     Since adders are part of board, we must use the total board quantity to determine the adder cost
                    .

                    NOTES
                    In the folding carton estimate, the LM deparment is an ASITRADE machine that laminates medium and
                     liner paper to a top printed offset sheet.
                    In the corrugated estimate, the CR department is a corrugator that laminates 3 to 8 paper materia
                    l to make different flute grades.   
                    If the programming is easier, for corrugated estimates, we can add the department LM after the CR
                     department in the machine file for the corrugator.

                    Database for both companies will run from company 001 Premier Packaging via Louisville, KY server
                    .  They want unique forms for the Chicago location which would have a new address and logo  assoc
                    iated with each form.
                    Therefore, the modification is for all forms to print by customer or vendor code.   Each forms pr
                    int routine must be changed to search for a specific form by vendor or customer.
                    The N-K-1 control parameter folder called "view form" tab (see attached) would house the specific
                     form by customer or vendor.   If this is BLANK, then the existing form defined on the VIEW FORM 
                    folder would print.  
                    Therefore each print routine must be changed to first search the VIEW FORM folder to select the f

E-R-7-   06170905 E Change Report to Find Last Job# from J-U-1
                    A PREP code on an estimate may be used by many Finished Goods Items.
                    For example, PLATE may be used on many jobs.
                    The data collection module writes the LAST job number to the E-B-8 Prep file.
                    The E-R-7 report simply prints this job number.
                    This is not dynamic enough.
                    New Logic should find the last job number for the FG Item on the estimate.
                    
                    Examples of Bad Data at Fibre Follow:
                    Prep Code 4434 ? Shows last JOB 110219 (this is wrong).  It also shows last ORDER 110493 (this is
                     correct).
                    Prep Code 6919 ? Shows last JOB 98507 (this is wrong).  It also shows last ORDER 96419 (this is c
                    orrect).
                    Prep Code 7555 ? Shows last JOB 99053 (this is wrong).  It also shows last ORDER 116340 (this is 
                    correct).
                    Seems pretty consistent where the JOB # is wrong but the ORDER # is correct on these.
                    
                    
                    ASI Response:
                    Please note, the Plate or Die must exist on the SPEC folder under Plate# and/or Die#
