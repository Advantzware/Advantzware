How to show matching open parenthese in the procedure editor (VSLick)
=====================================================================

It seems there are two possible cases, probably depending on the fact you customized the default config of VSlick with the AppBuilder regular config tool (option->Editing Option)

If you have a 'proedit' sub-directory in your working directory, with a file called user.vlx in it, then do the following:
1) make a backup copy of the config file <workingDir>\proedit\user.vlx in <workingDir>\proedit\user.vlx.original
      => The point is just to be safe

2) Open the text file <workingDir>\proedit\user.vlx

3) In the a line close to the bottom:
punctuation= & ( ) * + , - . / : ; < <= <> = > >= ? @ [ ] ^ { {get {set

Remove the ) character so it becomes
punctuation= & ( * + , - . / : ; < <= <> = > >= ? @ [ ] ^ { {get {set

4) Save it.

5) Start an AppBuilder/procedure editor.  Then play with the open and close parentheses... you will love it.



However, if you do not have the <workingDir>\proedit\user.vlx file, then follow these steps:
1) make a backup copy of <Progress Install Dir>\proedit\vslick.vlx

2) Then modify the following line near the bottom in <Progress Install Dir>\proedit\vslick.vlx :

symbol1= & ( ) * + , - . / : ; < <= <> = > >= ? @ [ ] ^ { {get {set } ~

   Into:

symbol1= & ( * + , - . / : ; < <= <> = > >= ? @ [ ] ^ { {get {set } ~

   ( => just remove the ')' character )

3) Save the file

4) Restart the AppBuilder or Procedure editor


Again guys... "hack it or die"  ;p

Kind regards
