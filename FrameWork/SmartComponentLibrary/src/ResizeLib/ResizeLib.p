    Purpose     : General method for resize of Progress Windows

    Syntax      :

    Description :

    Author(s)   : Brynjar Hasle, Chemistry as. brynjar@chemistry.no
    Created     : 01.03.2002
    Modified:   : 01.04.2003: Added support for vertical and horizontal split bar
                  New functions: 
                    setSplitBarX: 
                        Called from initializeObject and END-MOVE 
                        of vertical split-bar button
                    setSplitBarY: 
                        Called from initializeObject and END-MOVE 
                        of horizontal split-bar button
                    DoWidgetSplitResize:
                        Called from setSplitBarX and setSplitBarY
                        
                  Also restructured setWidgetResize function and removed 
                  the recursive part of it to function DoWidgetResize
