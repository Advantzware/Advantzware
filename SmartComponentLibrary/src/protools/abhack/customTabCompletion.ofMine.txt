# protools/abhack/customTabCompletion.ofMine.txt is a list of custom aliases to extend the 
# standard aliases defined in protools/abhack/customTabCompletion.txt 
# 
# This new file introduced on 24-MAR-2007 will help to keep your own aliases when 
# applying a new release of ABHack with possible changes in the standard 
# protools/abhack/customTabCompletion.txt 
# 
# 
# Do not forget to put a carriage return at the end of the file
# Lines that begins with '#' are ignored 
# This file is reloaded each time you recheck the '&Custom completion' toggle-box 
# One can define aliases for the matches operator 
# ~n => insert carriage return 
# %\d  => date in your *own* format (European, or American) => better than with VSlick 
# %\c put the cursor there  /* 18-DEC-2006 sla: Improvement: %\c now work for aliases that insert multiple lines */ 
# %\( will make ABHack insert a '(' in such a way it can guess where to put the matching ')' 
# %\wBuffer => to be replaced by the next chosen buffer in a popup list  /* 17-FEB-2007 sla: new buffer directive */
# 
# Example to disable a standard alias 
lirtn @dislabledAlias@ 
# Example to abort the completion process for a given word 
blockCompletion @abortCompletionProcess@ 
# 
# To implement your own, have a look at the standard protools/abhack/customTabCompletion.txt 
#
