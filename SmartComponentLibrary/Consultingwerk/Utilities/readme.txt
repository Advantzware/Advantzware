The Consultingwerk.Utilities package contains routines that may be useful but are not required for the functionality of the SmartComponent Library, SmartFramework or the WinKit.

Compilation of these files requires the .NET framework and an installation of MS Excel including the COM-Interop Assemblies. 

When this causes trouble with the installation, you may simply drop this folder!
