slacroix 27-AUG-2008:
added usage of the {&pure4gltvrootpath} preprocessor in the reference of {{&pure4gltvrootpath}pure4gltvwindows.i}


slacroix 5-AUG-2008:
Added code to the updateNode API so it can also handle the new node options introduced in Ovtober last year.


slacroix 25-JAN-2008:
Improved the creation of dyn popup menu on right click by first deleting
a possible existing dyn popup menu.  Before that, it was somtimes necessary to do a double
right-click in order to obtain a wanted popup menu.



Simon L Prinsloo, Dries Feys and slacroix 28-NOV-2007
Add a double-click event on the nodes in the bottom of the tree, provided that the "AddOnExpand" is not set for the node.

New node options for the addNode API:
  fgColor= 
  bgColor=
  font=
  tooltip=
 => See demo usage of new these new options in the choose trigger of the "Small TV" button of the provided testSmart4glTv.w sample.


slacroix 04-AUG-2007 
Fixed regression introduced with the search on keyStroke for the '-', '+' and '*' key events
Indeed, they were caught by the focusCatcher combo-box to perform search on keyStroke
instead of letting the fMainKeyEvent procedure doing the initial collapse,
expand or expandAll functionalities



slacroix 25-JUL-2007
 1) Added support of the Aero skin for winVista

 2) Review to remove errors returned by functions for compliance with more consistent
 error handling introduced in 10.1C 
    Note: In the past, I had a few FUNCTION capable of returning an ERROR: CollapseNode(), ExpandNode() and NodeInCollapsedBranch()
    Actually, the point was more to show my design intention for cases that should not occur.  The AVM
    could not raise an error in the caller at this time (it will in 10.1C), so it was not a problem to
   just return NO or unknow instead



slacroix 19-JUN-2007 
New option in addNode of pure4glTv so superceed the autoSort TV option for one single
node, and made abhack use it for the parameters.  See header comment of addNode() for more info



slacroix 16-JUN-2007
 1) New ApplyEntry strong override to really apply entry to the treeview by using the
 focusCatcher combo.
 
 2) New search by keyStroke feature.  When the focus is in the treeview (actually
 in the hidden focusCatcher static combo), pure4gltv now maintains a string composed
 by the last keystrokes with up to 1500ms between each strike (above this time, the
 string is reset to blank), then searches the next brother node (same parent as current
 node) which label begins with the mentioned string.  The search uses an index against
 parent + label that has always been present, so this feature is very fast and cool.
 When we cannot find a next brother based on the searched label, then pure4gltv tries
 to find a first brother node.  Of course, when the search is successful, then the
 found brother node is selected and brought into the viewPort if necessary with the
 selectNode API
 
 3) Added protection against unsupported skins like aero now for WinVista (until) someone sends
 me the necessary pictures).  When I find out the theme is not supported in the
 tvSkins directory, pure4gltv goes into classic mode and gives some details in the
 tooltip of the EMPTY square on the right bottom corner.




slacroix 09-JUN-2007
1) implemented a new nodeDisplay event a bit similar to a Browse ROW-DISPLAY event:
  /* 08-APR-2007 sla: new nodeDisplay hook to give the ability to refine a node just before it gets displayed
    it's up to the container to subscribe to this event.  It is a bit like a ROW-DISPLAY trigger in a browse
    This way, one can  refine node labels just before they get displayed.  One nice example is a new prospy++ 
    that displays a huge trace in a treeview with time information.  This time info can be either an absolute time
    or a relative time, or a node cost or branch cost.  In the past, without this hook, I had to reupdate the labels
    of the all treview when the end user was choosing a different display mode, which was very slow when the treeview was
    containing half a million of nodes....  Now, it is just *instant* since I refresh I prepare the node label just
    when it is about to be displayed ;) */

2) Provided additional pictures to be used in a new prospy++ and in ABHack


slacroix & Nicolas Andricq MAR-2006
1) Support of Royale skin.  Restructuration to support multiple skins

2) Review of the vertical scrollbar to avoid a hole of two pixels on the right.

3) new getSelectedNodeKey() API 



slacroix Later in MAR-2006
1) New expandBranch API that is fired on '*' key trigger

2) New enableObject and disableObject API's

3) New expandAll functionality on '*' key 
 
4) Made a new version of Prospy that uses pure4gl tv for greater performance




VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
====================

The POV package includes a version of pure4gltv.w that works fine in 9.1E and 10.0B01
In OE10, one may hit the following error:
Mismatched number of parameters passed to routine ShowScrollBar Windows.p. (3234)

This is due to the fact that OE 10 uses a modified version of windows.p and
winfun.p (originaly made by Jurjen Dijkstra, 1997 - 1999 http://www.global-shared.com)


Pay attention to the following comment in the definition block of pure4gltv.w

/* Uncomment the following line when pure4gltv.w is used in a Dynamics
environment, so the same windows.p and winfun.p libraries can be used for both
Dynamics and pure4gltv
&SCOPED-DEFINE useDynamicsWinAPIs*/

/*  In OpenEdge 10, or with Dynamics, one may uncomment the following lines
to avoid error:
 Mismatched number of parameters passed to routine ShowScrollBar Windows.p. (3234)
&SCOPED-DEFINE APIRtnParm  ,OUTPUT DummyAPIRtnVal
&SCOPED-DEFINE APIRtnParmINT  ,OUTPUT DummyAPIRtnValINT */
