Step to Duplicate.
1)  Create Release for INVOICE only for 25,000 boxes.
2)  Click INVOICE button to create invoice. 
      This creates a -25000 from Customer Blank and 25000 for customer IBM1000.

3)   Next create SHIP ONLY Release for FIVE Tags.
       Click BOL button to create Tags.
4)   Post BOL to create Invoice.
      For each BOL Line (Each tag) 
      This creates a 5000 from Customer Blank and -5000 for customer IBM1000.
      Since there are two tags, there are 10 new TRANSFER transactions.
      They all have the same Date and Time.  
      Five Transfers with 5000 with no Customer and Five -5000 Transfers for IBM1000
