====================================================================================================

TODO / Plans:

- Autocheck on new version
  Check should be made against OEHive page.
  Let user set toggle on settings window or do a manual check in an 'about' window

- Let user define own colors in .ini (oddDataRow / evenDataRow, queryError, recordCount, primIndex, changedFormat)
  Something like this:
  
  [DataDigger:fonts]
  font:default                 =  4
  font:fixed                   =  2
  ExpextedSizeFont0 = 
  
  [DataDigger:colors]
  color:oddDataRow             =  1 /  ?
  color:evenDataRow            =  1 /  8 
  color:queryError             = 14 / 12
  color:recordCountComplete    =  2 /  ?
  color:recordCountNotComplete = 12 /  ?
  color:primIndex              =  8 /  ?
  color:changedFormat          = 12 /  ?
  color:changedOrder           = 12 /  ?
  color:filterName             =  7 /  ?
  color:inactiveIndex          = 12 /  ?

- Provide alternative icon sets. 
  Default icons now have prefix 'default_'

- Extra options in 'About DataDigger' Window 
  option to see changelog (remove from main window)
  add easter egg (pacman?)
  option to check on new version / download new one
