To uninstall ProTop:

1) Stop any background processes that you might have enabled.

Most systems will only need to have bin/dbmonitor.sh running in the
background. The dbmonitor process will then handle starting and stopping
agents automatically.

On UNIX systems dbmonitor is typically started as a cron job but it is
possible to start it manually or via the etc/init.d sorts of processes
or by other site-specific means.

On Windows dbmonitor is optionally added as a service when you install
ProTop. It is also possible (but not recommended) to run it as a manually
or as a "scheduled task". If you are uninstalling ProTop on Windows you
should check the services and stop the "ProTop3 DB Monitor" service.

2) If you are on Windows there might be a registry entry pointing to
the ProTop install directory.  You can search for this with regedit
and remove it if you would like.  Search for:

   "Software\White Star Software\ProTop" "installdir"

3) If you had setup a web portal and would like it removed send an email to
info@wss.com and we will delete your portal data. It is helpful if you can
include your "custId" which can be found in ${PROTOP}/etc/custid.cfg.

4) Remove the ${PROTOP} or %PROTOP% directory.

5) If you have any feedback regarding your experiences with ProTop feel
free to share it with info@wss.com. If you had a bad experience we want to
learn about that so that we can improve the product in the future.  If
ProTop did not meet your needs tell us what was missing -- maybe that is
also something that we can work on!
