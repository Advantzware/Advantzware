Release Notes 3.141
===================

-1) In case you've skipped a few releases -- ProTop ChUI now requires a
minimum screen size of 160 columns by 48 rows -- 4x an old 80x24 green
screen.

0) Don't get used to this. Really. It is just a coincidence that these
release notes are getting created. You have been warned.

1) Updated db startup parameter discovery to accomodate the purging of
_Startup and _Statbase with oe12.

2) Modified the r-code build process to not compile lib/setpt3dir.p. The
build is executed on Linux but that code contains Windows specific
pre-processors which (obviously on retrospection) fail if you compile on
Linux. The solution is to provide xcoded source for that program rather
than r-code.  (Source code deployments are not impacted.)

3) Fixed an issue with formatting the messages.cfg download command.

4) Modified bin/pt3upd.sh to no longer bark when it is overwritten by
extracting an update tar file on top of itself (shell scripts hate that
for some reason).  If you see an error at the end of pt3upd.sh just
run it again.  That will very likely cure the problem.
