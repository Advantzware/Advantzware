ubin
----

These programs are free tools collected from various places (many, but not
all come from "gnuwin32") that support unix-like commands in a Windows
environment.

This is *much* lighter weight than something like Cygwin.

I find these tools to be very helpful when I am working on Windows.

You do not need these if you are already running Unix or Linux. But you
might find them handy if you have Windows machines elsewhere in your
environment.

You can use the character ProTop 3 without these tools if you modify
bin\protop.bat to not use grep and gawk.
