Config File Notes
-----------------

Most configuration files will be re-read if they are changed. If changes
require a restart that should be noted below.


custid.cfg
----------

The customer Id for this instance of ProTop. You must have a unique
customer Id in order to use the web back-end (util/pt3agent.p).

Customer Ids are obtained by emailing tom@wss.com

If you change the custId you must restart all of ProTop.


deploy.cfg
----------

This identifies what sort of deployment this is.  The various types are:

    src		source (you must have a 4gl compiler license available)
    rx		encrypted source (usable with -rx)
    rcd-###	r-code for some particular version of OpenEdge

The deployment type will be used by the auto-update procedure (bin/pt3upd
or via pt3agent) to fetch the proper package. So don't mess with this file!


dblist.cfg
----------

This is thelist of "known databases". Each database has a friendly name, a
server name and a flag indicating whether or not it is to be monitored by
pt3agent. If the flag is set to "yes" then a pt3agent will be launched and
monitoring data will be sent to the ProTop web back end.

Friendly names must be unique to this custId.

A database can have multiple friendly names.

The friendly name can be used as a parameter when starting a ProTop session.

etc/dblist.cfg is built and maintained via the bin/dbmaint script.


protop.cfg
----------

Various global ProTop settings are contained in etc/protop.cfg.


highlight.cfg
-------------

This file describes rules for highlighting metrics in the character ProTop
screens.


messages.cfg
------------

Progress OpenEdge messages that might appear in the database .lg file and
how to react to them. If running, dbmonitor will watch the .lg file for
these messages and react accordingly.


email.cfg
---------

OBSOLETE -- previously used to define the os-command to use to send email.

This configuration file is no longer used and can be deleted.


appsrv.cfg
----------

A list of App Servers to be monitored via the ProTop "@" command.


pt3agent.cfg
------------

Settings for the pt3 background agent.

This configuration file is NOT re-read on changes.

Each friendly name can have an individualized config file. I.e.
pt3agent.friendly.cfg

  ptInitDC is the list of data collectors (the dc/* directory) to be
  run by pt3agent. This controls what data is available on the web
  back end.

  monInt is the monitoring sample interval in seconds.
