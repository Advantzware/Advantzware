Windows BAT file README
=======================

Files in %PROTOP%\bin that are downloaded and installed by ProTop will be
overwritten and updated by future releases and updates. DO NOT CUSTOMIZE
THESE FILES.

ProTop does NOT install %PROTOP%\bin\localenv.bat so it will always be safe
to customize %PROTOP%\bin\localenv.bat.

If localenv.bat exists it will be executed at the end of protopenv.bat
which allows for quite a lot of localization. See localenv.batx for an
example.

Files with a .BATX extension are samples. They may require customizations
and tweaks to be used in the local environment.

If there is a .BATX file then ProTop is not providing a .BAT version.

ProTop only overwrites BAT and BATX files that are provided by ProTop -- so
the idea is to copy BATX files to BAT files if they contain something that
you would like to use. The BATX file may get updated but the BAT will not.
