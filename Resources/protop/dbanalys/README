The files in this directory are expected to be named:

	dbAlias.dba

"dbAlias" is the unique, user-defined, alias of the db as defined in
etc/dblist.cfg.

This "friendly name" is the first item displayed in the upper left corner
of the ProTop screen if a friendly name was used (it will say "Direct" if
a db path was used).

In this way you can have multiple *.dba files from databases that have the
same physical name.

If ProTop does not find a match it will look for a match to ldbname.dba.
This will work so long as there is only one instance of a given ldbname on
the server.

The files are read by the data collector on the server-side.  For direct
connections this is the same machine that the client runs on.
