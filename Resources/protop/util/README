ProTop 3 util/*
===============

The programs in this directory communicate with the ProTop 3 back end web
servers.

This is necessary to provide the web browser interface.

If you do not wish to have your monitoring data sent to these servers do
not run these programs.

If you chose to use the web interface you will need a "custId".  You can
obtain a custId by emailing tom@wss.com.

Your monitoring data is only be available to site administrators and
to accounts whom you create logins for.  The only data transmitted to the
back end is monitoring and db analysis data -- Progress VST metrics,
database utility and operating system information.  No application data
is transmitted.

If your company would prefer an on-premise installation rather than a
cloud based solution please contact tom@wss.com.
