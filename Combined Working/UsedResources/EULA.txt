LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT 

This agreement to use Advantzware (“The Product”) is licensed, not sold, to You for use only under the terms of this license, unless a Product is accompanied by a separate license agreement, in which case the terms of that separate license agreement will govern, subject to Your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement. Advantzware (“Licensed Application Provider”) reserves all rights not expressly granted to You. The Product that is subject to this license is referred to in this license as the “Licensed Application.” 
By clicking to accept an electronic version of this Agreement or by installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Application, you agree to be bound by this Agreement.  This Agreement is enforceable against you and any entity that installs or uses the Licensed Application on your behalf (e.g., system integrator, consultant, or contractor).  If you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of an entity for which you work, you agree that you have the authority to bind the entity and that the entity will be bound by this Agreement.

If you do not agree, do not install, copy, or otherwise use the Licensed Application, and return the Licensed Application and any passwords for it to your place of purchase for a refund in accordance with the applicable refund policies.  
a. Scope of License: This license granted to You for the Licensed Application by Application Provider is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Licensed Application on any device that You own or control.  This license does not allow You to use the Licensed Application on any device that You do not own or control, and You may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time in excess of the number of users you have licensed and are currently paying license and support for. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Licensed Application). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Application Provider. If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by Application Provider that replace and/or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern. 
b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Application Provider may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about Your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to You (if any) related to the Licensed Application.

c. Termination. The license is effective until terminated by You or Application Provider. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Application Provider if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this license.
