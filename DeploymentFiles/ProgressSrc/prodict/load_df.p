File: prodict/load_df.p

    End-user entry point for Admin Tool's "Load .df file" utility
      
Input Parameters:
    df-file-name    The name of the .df file to be loaded into DICTDB
    
Output Parameters:
    none
    
Used/Modified Shared Objects:
    defines several NEW SHARED objects
    
History:
    Mario B.    99/03/18    Added user_env[19] to signal _lodsddl.p that it is
                            being called by this code.  If so, _lodsddl.p
                            eliminates the display of any "remaining"
                            alert-boxes not dealt with by prior modifications
                            designed to handle this issue.  
    tomn        08/29/95    Added check for codepage spec in .df file
                            trailer; Leaves as UNDEFINED if none specified
    mcmann      07/13/98    Added check for both cpstream and codepage
    mcmann      03/14/01    Added ability to pass in two entries in input parameter
                            to allow user to commit when errors are found.
    mcmann      04/23/02    Added ability to pass in three entries so that the
                            user can do on-line schema adds.
    mcmann      10/17/03    Add NO-LOCK statement to _Db find in support of on-line schema add
    kmcintos    07/28/05    Added check for false alarm in read_bits 
                            20050727-041.
    fernando    06/20/07    Support for large files
    fernando    07/21/08    Support for encryption
    fernando    03/20/09    Additional changes for encryption
    fernando    04/13/09    Changes for alternate buffer pool
    fernando    03/05/10    Fix code that checks rollback error
    hdaniels    03/26/10    Added CATCH in transaction and showLoadError
