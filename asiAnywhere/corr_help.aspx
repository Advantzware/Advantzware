            FOUNTAIN PEN ICON - This icon looks like a fountain pen and is used for 
            adding notes for each machine department, which are printed on the job ticket. 
            Department notes may be defined in the customer file, which will transfer to 
            any newly added estimate. This may be very useful for ISO9001 or quality 
            control notes. Each note is date and time stamped and notes may be entered 
            for each form number for each department code. The Form number 00 will be 
            used as general notes for a department. Miscellaneous departments such as 
            QC for quality control notes may be added to the estimate maintenance 
            department file.
