                    2)  FG Received does not need a Decimal.  Remove Decimal and digits to Right.
                    3)  Wasted Sheets does not need a Decimal number.
                    4)  Number Up is Incorrect.      See Job# 207616 which is from Estimate#  11707
                          The Estimate has 2 Out on the Sheeter and 12 up on the Press.
                    5)  Total Waste is Incorrect since the Number Up is Wrong.
                           To Test  -  See Job 207616 which has a sheet lenght of 35.10.
                     I issued 34,450 LF of two roll tags of SBS18-55 which converts to 11,778 sheets per J-Q-1
                    Total Sheets Issued = 24 x 11,778 = 282672  less 250,000 FG Received = 32,672 Blanks.
                    Or 32,672 / 24 = 1361 Sheets Wasted      Print all machines

                          I posted both the Machine SHT1 and Machine 408.
                    The estimate shows 12 up and 2 out on the Roll.
                    The Report shows 1 Up.

                    The Score Allowances are listed for the style RSC for A Flute.
                    There are actually score allowances for every Flute.
                    The SCORES button allows a copy from one Style to the Next Style.
                    However, it is buggy.
                    To Test.

                    2) Click View Style Tab
                    3) Click the Arrow Keys and See that all the Score Allowances are Zero

                    Estimate 8806 is for a die with four blanks on the form requiring 200, 200, 900 and 770.
                    The print out will show the request total quantity of pcs encircled in green (200+200+900+770 = 2
                    070).  Where the confusion is below that encircled in red the quantities shown are the yield quan
                    tities with the request price(s) beside these quantities.
                    The numbers in red should be the requested quantities.
                    I have also attached a .pdf of entire hard copy for estimate 8806

                    Existing Logic on Inks/Pack folder of Estimate
                               A)   Allows defining number of layer pads per carton.
                               B)   Allows defining number of case dividers per carton.
                    This does ot define layer pads per pallet.

                          Valid Options are C for Case or P for Pallet.
                    When new Field is a P for Pallet.
                    The finished goods item does not use corrugated cartons, the layer pad and/or divider,
                    (material types = 5 & 6 in the raw materials file).  The estimator will defined the number of lay
                    er pads per pallet.  
                    For Example, The Qty were 5 per Pallet.
                    The Estimate Qty / Pallet Count times Pads per Pallet is the Total Number of Pads.
                    Same Logic for Dividers
                    The Estimate Qty / Pallet Count times Dividers per Pallet is the Total Number of Pads.
                    Qty x Cost = Total Cost

                    When Specific Board Codes are Used.   
                    For Example,  From Board Code  200 C      To Board Code  200 C
                    This will find the estimate number on the Quote, then find the board codes on the estimate.
                    Updating Quote must match this Board Code and all other selections and toggle boxes.

                    Set has 1 200B RSC, 3 Length Partitions of 200C and 5 Width Partitions of ECT32.
                    If 200B increased 8%, 200C 9% and ECT32 10%.
                    Normally, price increase is done 1 time for perhaps by 9.5%.
                    So if quote was $500 per 1000 the New Price is $546 
                    However, if the Global price is done 3 times for 8%,9% & 10%, the Quote increases 27%
                    If you run this 3 times.  Sell Price is $663.58    $546 vs $663 is the Issue
                    User should not Run Multiple Times on Same Estimate.

                    This quote is needed in Excel so that it can be editted once printed to screen.
                    Quote form will be for *1ST ITEM ONLY*.  Because of the format, there can be only one Item on the

                    Both have Adder Charges but quote 2364 has 6 quanities which skips a line.
                    This skipped line bug happens with 5 quantiies or more.
                    It is missing the ADDER charger from the Layout Tab.

                    The Quote Form shows $200 which is the Cost without Markup or Amoritization.
                    For example, a plate charge is $200 with 20% Markup and amortization is 50%.
                    The quote and the orders MISC tab will show the Plate Charge =  $125
                    The Math is as follows: 
                    $200 / .80 = $250   Then the $250 x .50%  = $125
                    Modify Quote Form to print the Plate Charge Under the ITEM CODE.

                    Changed program so that after a tab on job number, it would find the bin based on what was on the
                     screen.   If that failed it will just find the first one as before.

I-F-1-   04071405 E New Toggle Box on  Bins/Jobs Tab called "Show Bins with Qty = 0
                    New toggle Box.  Show Bins if Qty = 0.  This will default to Not Display.
                    
                    All customers should run N-F-10 and Recalc Button and NOT Delete Zero Qty Bins.
                    However, the new Toggle Box will default to UnChecked.
                    This will HIDE the Bins with ZERO on Hand.
                    Except, OPEN Jobs.  They will still Display.
                    
                    Reason for new Toggle Box.
                    The calculated Bins table is needed to put the proper cost on reports.
                    This table is also needed to transfer costs to a posted invoice.
                    For example, 
                    A csutomer receives and shipped a product such as ATT-2297 for Job 205938
                    The Tags are received and shipped and show zero on Hand.
                    If the Recalc Qtyt is run and the DELETE zero Qty Bins is Run. the Tags are Removed.
                    When Customers runs  I-R-2 for a date after the Receeipt but Before the Shipment.
                    The Bin/Tags would appear o the Report.
                    The Problem is the Cost cannot be found in the Bins Table.
                    Then the Program imports the Average Cost form the VIEW Table which is Wrong.
                    Keeping the Bins Table Open will Ensure the Cost is Correct on IR2 and other Programs.

                    Whether you delete the Estimate# or Keep Estimate#, the logic should work the same.
                    There are now two open POS.
                    I delete the attachment showing the PO# which removes the Attachment from that PO#.
                    However the Attachment without a PO# is still showing on the PaperClip of the other Open PO#.
                    Obviously, we should not need the PO# listed on the Attachment
                    
                    Client needs to DELETE certain attachments from the PO, which will not delete the PaperClip from

I-F-1-   10221401 E Add *Wildcard* search
                    Add *Wildcard* Search to all fields on the following Fields.
                    1)  F1 on  Customer Part#
                         Click Autofind  on Item#,  Name or Part#.
                         *Bubble*

                         *Bubble*   This Works Perfectly.
                        However.  
                        Click AutoFind on Estimate# and I cannot find any Estimates.

                    1)  I-F-1 ReCalc Cost Button Works Great.
                          The button Imports Cost from HISTORY to rebuild Bins Tab then the View Item Tab.
                           However, this only fixes ONE FG item at a time.
                           The * Option allows fixing the Entire Inventory.
                    This needs improvement
                    a)      Replace * Option with the Following
                    b)     Add toggle Box called ___ Include Inactive Items.    Similar logic to N-F-10.
                    c)     Add  From Customer __________     To Customer  __________
                             This will Default to customer for Item displayed on screen.

                    For Example, Search for Item = Sewa
                    1)  An error message is displayed.
                    2)  All of the search fields are cleared
                    3)  All items are displayed in the browse
                    
                    NEW LOGIC:
                    If the user searches for an item in IF1 and that item is not found:
                    For example, search for Item =  Sewa
                    
                    1) "No Items Found, please update your Search Criteria" 
                    2)  Seach Fields are not Cleared and Remain as entered, 
                         with the cursor active in the field last used

                    This can be by added by Unique Customer Part# or the Generic Part#.
                    
                    Adding Quotes for Finished Goods will import the Sales Rep from Totals/CP# Table if Defined.
                    Adding Estimate with a Finished Goods Item will import the Rep frrom Totals/CP# Table.
                    O-U-1 Add Order, With Estimates will continue to import  the Rep frrom Estimate.
                    O-U-1 Add Order, Without Estimate will import  the Rep frrom Totals/CP# Table.
                    O-B-1 Add Invoice  will import  the Rep frrom Totals/CP# Table.
                    
                    Please 
                    When invoices are created, the sales rep transferred from the order to the invoice.
                    All commissions and sales reports print based on the sales rep on the invoice.
                    However, currently Finished Goods reports print the sales rep from the customer file.
                    The following finished goods reports must be changed to print from the I-F-1 file if a sales rep 
                    exists.  If the rep is blank in the I-F-1 Totals Tab, then print from Customer File.

                    where and I just recreated them. Please investigate.
                    
                    ASI response:
                    Deletion of blank Itemfg appears to be the cause of the FG bins disappearing.
                    Adding tracking to the create trigger of itemfg to get information about the source of the blank 
                    fg item since it still seems to happen, despite several tasks to prevent it.
                    Customer will contact us when a blank fg item appears again, so we should deploy modified create.

                    ALSO Task 12091410 has logic to add a SALES REP field to the Total/CP# field.
                    Once added, this task can be completed.
                    It is possible to have a different sales rep for each customer on the Totals/CP# Field.
                    But, there will be only one Rep on the Totals/ CP#  tab that matches the Customer with Status X. 
                    For example, FG item 8x8x8 has a customer = STOCK, who has a status = X.
                    That is the Sales Rep that will be used on the FG Report.
                    A) If the existing report pulls the sales rep from the order, then no programming is needed.
                    B) If the existing report pulls the sales rep from the Customer File, this must be changed.
                         1)  If the Sales Rep Feild is blank, then the existing logic will be used.
                         2)  If the Totals/CP# has a Sales Rep defined, this REP will print on the Report.
                    Please Note.
                    It is OK to add logic to both Legacy Report and New Report Writer Format

                    For example. Job 207627 for FG Item Strawberry
                    I added receipts on 05/26/2014  but I posted the transactions on 05/28/14
                    The current date field print 05/26/14
                    However, the Print Selection Range must be for 05/28/14 to print this transaction.
                    It is a bit confusing.
                    
                    To make this more friendly.
                    Add the new date field as option to print on reported.

                    1) FG Category   (Report Heading will be Catgy)   This will print from I-F-1 View Item tab.
                    2) Unit Cost          This the the Total Standard Cost from the I-F-1 Jobs/Bin File.
                                                     Currently the Grand Total Cost for the Entire Quantity prints.
                                                     For example print for Item Strawberry for May 1 to May 30, 2014
                                                     The standard Unit Cost = $450.50 per M
                                                     The grand Total for each Tag# is $11,262.50

                    The order shows $ 125.00 per CS selling Unit of Measure.

                    Additional selectable columns need to be added to the IL8 report.  These are release-specific col
                    umns similar to the Release Qty and Rel Date fields that already exist.  The same Release lines f
                    rom OU1 Release tab should be used for these columns.  The Release break out is available when on
                    ly the "Detail" option is checked.  When "Summary is checked" these columns should show data the 
                    same way the Rel Date and Rel Qty columns (not sure if it just shows one release or blanks but it
                     should be consistent).
                    
                    The columns to add are:
                    1. Release PO# - This PO should be the Customer PO from the release line that corresponds to the 
                    release qty and release date that is currently available.
                    2. Release Lot# - This should be the Customer Lot#  from the release line that corresponds to the
                     release qty and release date that is currently available.
                    3. Prod. Qty for Lot - This needs to use the "Customer Lot# (column 2 above) to identify receipts
                     in IF1 History tab that have that Lot# as the FG Lot#.  Note: this column may be slow to calcula
                    te.  Only calculate the data for this, if the column is selected for inclusion.  
                    
                    ASI testing: See ASI Order 207823.  There are 2 releases.  One release has a Customer Lot # of 12
                    3.  This should correspond to a receipt for ATT-2297 of 20,000.  This would be the value that sho
                    uld be shown for #3 for this release.  The other release line has no Lot# and would thus show 0.

                    This should be controlled by the value of spare-int-1.
                    
                    Override this should act as follows:
                    If user checks this manually, check to see that a signature image exists locally.  If it doesn't,
                     check the web service for that specific BOL.  If it does not exist in either location, present a
                     warning message that says "Signature image does not exist.  Do you want to mark BOL as signed an
                    yway?" (yes/no). 
                    
                    If user uncheks this manually, check to see if an image exists locally or on the web-service.
                    If it does, ask the user if they want to delete the image:
                    "A signature has been captured for this BOL.  Do you want to delete it?" (yes/no)
                    Hitting yes will remove the local image file.

                    Task 12091410 has logic to add a SALES REP field to the Total/CP# field.
                    Once added, this task can be completed.
                    It is possible to have a different sales rep for each customer on the Totals/CP# Field.
                    But, there will be only one Rep on the Totals/ CP#  tab that matches the Customer with Status X. 
                    For example, FG item 8x8x8 has a customer = STOCK, who has a status = X.
                    That is the Sales Rep that will be used on the FG Report.
                    
                    A) If the existing report pulls the sales rep from the order, then no programming is needed.
                    B) If the existing report pulls the sales rep from the Customer File, this must be changed.
                         1)  If the Sales Rep Feild is blank, then the existing logic will be used.
                         2)  If the Totals/CP# has a Sales Rep defined, this REP will print on the Report.

                    ggle Box Set Header?  and Assembled?  are both Checked.
                    Reason for the Business Logic.  Components are produced at Plant A then Transferred to Plant B fo
                    r assembly.  Pallet Tags are stored in various bin locations in Plant B.   Pallet Tags must be tr
                    ansferred to the Plant Floor Bin called Assembly.   Only the tags transferred to Assembly should 
                    be subtracted from On hand when the Set Receipts are Received On Hand.
                    
                    Character Value = ASSEMBLY  is the Bin Location of all Set Components that are consummed and Disp
                    layed on the FG Receipts SET PARTS Tab.  For each Warehouse that assembles SETS and use the N-K-1
                     FGSetAssembly logoc must have a bin location called ASSEMBLY.   This will be the bin location th
                    at set components are consummed when receiving Sets.
                    
                    Logical Value = No will use existing Logic that pulls random inventory.
                    Logical Value = YES will turn on this new logic for Adding receipts for assembled sets.
                    Both O-U-7 Loadtag creation and  I-U-1 Set Receipts will Recieve the Set to the warehouse and bin
                     location based on existing logic.   However, the Components Warehouse will default to the Sets W
                    arehouse.   But, the components Bin Location will first search on hand Pallet Tags from the Bin L
                    ocation called ASSEMBLY.   If there is insufficent component inventory in the Assembly Bin Locati
                    on, the program will import existing bin Locations.     However, I-U-5 Inventory Posting will not
                     post set receipts or components unless all components have the Assembly Bin locations.  The I-U-
                    5 Posting report will show the message,  "Component Assembly Bin Location is Required"  and they 
                    will not Post until Componetns Bin = Assembly.
                    
                    
I-U-1-   04221406 B Add & Update Button or F1 Lookup on Tag# for SET PARTS Tab

                    Add receipt for Job W11623 for Set Item FAT TIRE for 200 Sets.
                    This auto assigns Tags on the SET Parts tab as Negative Adjustments.
                    However, I cannot change the Tags on the Sets Parts Tab.
                    
                    The program picked tag FAT TIRE-1     00025 and created -200 Qty..
                    However, lets assume that the plant used 4 other tags.
                    Currently there is no way to select tags FAT TIRE-1     00016,17, 3 & 5 which total 200 on hand.
                    I need a way to pick the tags and the program will import the On Hand Qty but change the on hand 
                    to a Negative Qty.
                    I should be able to change the negative quantity to a smaller qty than the on hand in the bin.  H
                    owever, I should not be able to type a negative qty greater than the on hand.

I-U-1-   05131401 E Set Parts Tab  - Receiving Screens - Add Select Bins/Tags Button
                    Selecting the appropriate bins/tags from which to relieve component inventory when receiving a se
                    t header is a time consuming process.   This modification will create a "Select Bins/Tags" button
                    , similar to the function that is available in OS1 and OT1.
                    
                    Component bins will be automatically selected when a set header is received in I-U-1.  The N-K-1 
                    FGSETASSEMBLY logic will pull from bin locations specified in the character value of this NK1 whi
                    ch may be used to pull component from a staging area location called ASSEMBLY.  This mod would be
                     in addition to the automatic bin selection process and will allow the user to change component b
                    in/tag locations quickly and easily.
                    
                    When the user selects one of the lines in the Set Parts tab and hits the Select Bin/Tags button, 
                    a multi-select browse window will pop-up, listing all on-hand bins for the selected component ite
                    m.  The window should have a running tally of the total qty selected next to the total qty needed
                    .  All validation that exists in the OS1 "Select Bin/Tags" button should apply to this new button
                    .
                    
                    Note:  This button should only apply to Assembled Sets.  Furthermore, for Assembled with Parts re
                    ceipts, only purchased components should allow this selection, since manufactured items have a "w
                    ash" transaction of receipt and reduction in inventory.

I-U-1-   06031401 B Set Parts Tab - Can't change whse/bin location of tag
                    Premier was unable to change the WHSE BIN for a set component receipt (negative).
                    The tag was originally received into PROD/STG6 then transferred to UPS/UPSJPMC.  The FG Bin shows
                     the full qty in UPS/UPSJPMC but there is still a 0 qty bin for PROD/STG6.
                    The validation in IU1 for the set component receipt finds the first bin that exists for the tag. 
                     In Premier's case, the first bin found was the 0 qty bin for PROD/STG6.  The logic needs to igno
                    re the 0 qty bin.

                    See Video File Attached.
                    This is a video of the occasional problem with the RFID hotfolder. Based on the last attempt to r
                    emedy this I MUST insist on testing out any suggested remedies off line, to avoid the problems fr
                    om last month?s attempt. I?ve been monitoring the N:\RCODE\rfidtags directory for several months 
                    now but this needs to be corrected. Notice on the video that when this ERROR occurs that I copy t
                    he file into N:\RCODE\rfidtags\Errors directory which currently has over 70 dating back to early 
                    last month, however this has been going on for much longer. Although the 70 or so files is just a
                     1.8% failure rate to the amount of files that have been processed our goal is perfection, or som
                    ething much closer. Also, notice the Clear Log button on the RFID Monitor application, perhaps a 
                    ?mod? to remove that and replace it with some sort of dual Clear/Archive functionality. I?ve been
                     archiving monthly logs since the beginning of this but I have this fear that someone is going to
                     hit that ?Clear Log? button and erase valuable data. The archived logs can be found in N:\RCODE\
                    rfidtags\monitor\Archived\ directory. I began archiving this just because the original Monitor.lo
                    g file ballooned to over 60mb that seemed to be grinding down the system at the time. I even trie
                    d moving all of the archived data out of that location thinking that maybe its existence was crea

I-U-1-   09251404 B Negative Qty Receipts for Tags Already Received and Posted
                    See Attached.
                    See PO# 102689 for FG item 5x5x5
                    O-U-7 was used to Create 5 Pallet Tags of 1000 Each.
                    500 boxes were damanged on the Tag# 5X5X5          00110  
                    This requires a negative 500 for this tag.
                    A negative receipt will automatically lower the PO Quantity Received.
                    Likewise the A/P Invoice will import the receipt Quantity of 4500 after 500 is returned.
                    Problem is ASI does not allow a Receipt for the Same Tag#.

                    2)  New Button OK will import the On Hand Quantity as a Negative.
                          Previously Received Tag will not accept a POSITIVE quantity.
                          Only a Negative Quantity can be entered.

                    This mod will change the logic used to select component bins when receiving an assembled set head
                    er in I-U-1, SharpShooter, and OU7 (when Set Header receipts are automatically created - NOTE: Pr

                    ld ever appear on the Set Parts tab in IU1 or SS.
                    Additionally, upon receiving and saving a set header today, a pop-up will launch, warning the use
                    r that there is insufficient component inventory.
                    This exists today, however a new improved pop-up will display each component showing:
                    Component ID, Component Name, Qty/Set, Required Qty, Qty On-hand
                    Components with insufficient inventory will be highlighted in yellow.
                    When FGSetAssembly is YES, there will be NO option to create a set header receipt for a qty less 
                    than what is being originally received.  Hitting OK on the message will simply NOT save the recei
                    pt line and return the user back to the receipt application, ready to add (IU1) or scan (SS) the

                    N-K FGSetRec
                    Character Value = SET will transfer the Same Job#/Whse/Bin/Tag to the Set/PartsTab.
                    This should not transfer the Tag#.   This should only transfer the Job#/Whse/Bin.
                    Currently the Tag# on the Set Header is incorrectly  transferred to every component.
                    That is incorrect logic.   The Tag Number should be BLANK.
                    
                    Character Value = ITEM
                    This appears to work correctly importing blank tags.  
                    The warehouse and bin should pull from the Components Bins/Jobs.

                         ASI shows the Buttons, but no other can click the FARM Tab Buttons.
                    2)  Also, Set Header Receipts SHOULD NOT update the FARM Tab.
                         The Set Header Receipts creates Adjustments for Components as Negative Qty.
                         The Component Adjustments should not write to the J-U-1 Farm Tab History.
                          Also, expand format to allow negative qty in J-U-1 Farm Tab..
                    Please note.
                    Receipts for the Purchased Components for specific Orders/Jobs updates the ACTUAL Qty and Cost on
                     the JU1 Farm.
                    The Adjustment should not update the FARM Tab as this would incorrectly Reduce the Qty.

                    The Warehouse in the I-F-1 Inventory File is transferred to the I-U-1 Receipts Screen.
                    The I-F-1 may contain a warehouse that has been deleted from I-F-4.
                    
                    The Posting program should not post a warehouse that is invalid.
                    Hopefully, this does not slow down the posting process.
I-U-5-   07091410 B Error: No oe-ordl record is available (91) after posting Transfers
                    After transfers are posted, the post program runs a ReprintLoadtag routine.
                    Error message is caused by posting a transfer using a loadtag that has an order tied to it, but  
                    no longer has the item on that order.
                    
                    To test:
                    Post transfers and validate that no error occurs.  
                    Specifically, create a loadtag with a valid order number, but for an item that is not part of the
                     order.

                    This will secure the User Id on the I-U-5  Finished Goods Posting Program.
                    When pressing I-U-5, the new security program will be automatically created.
                    The Default User ID will be an asterik *
                    
                    If the User ID is listed on the security program then that user may change the User ID on the fin
                    ished goods posting program.
                    If the user ID is not defined in the new security program then the USER ID cannot be updated.
                    Currently, when pressing I-U-5, the User ID defaults.
                    That logic will continue, however, they cannot change the user id.
                    The net result is that they will not be able to change the user id and post another users transac

                    When posting a FARM Item, the Receipt Qty must update the J-U-1 Farm Tab for ACTUAL Qty.
                    Likewise when posteing a  Assembled Set with Parts, the set parts are also posted.
                    Specifcally a POSITIVE Receipt quantity  is created which should update the J-U-1 FARM Tab for To

                    This also creates an adjustment to the component inventory but that is not needed for the JU1 FAR

                    I add a receipt for 1000 stocksheets and posted it.
                    I run the IU7.  Then I checked the inventory (bins) for both and they were correct.
                    But if you recalc the quantity for the FG it adds the 1000 back since there isn't a negative Adju
                    stment posted to the history.
                    
                    Programmer Note (from BV):  
                    Doing a negative receipt would negate that the FGs were produced.
                    A negative receipt should not be the transaction added.  
                    Since the FG aren't getting shipped, they are just getting converted to RMs.
                    This should add an adjustment transaction, similar to the one that gets added for the consumption
                     of set components (Adjustments).

                    When Adding a Tag, the Units, Unit Count and Partial Count should Import.
                    However, the User and change the partial or the Number of Units.
                    
                    Only the Partial Qty on the Screen and the Number of Units will transfer to the new Tag#.
                    
                    
                    PLEASE NOTE.
                    Program assumes client consolidates only same job# and same Case Counts.
                    Also, Multiple partial Counts will combine partial Case which in Reality is not possible for Case

J-R-3-   02281403 B Toggle Box to Calculate Waste Miscalculates #up
                    Prystup Job 936 has 2 different board sizes issued.  The estimated board results in 4 up and that
                     is the typical case.
                    However, one of the boards on this job is slit in two resulting in 8 up.
                    When the Waste = Board Issued - Quantity Posted option is selected, the issued board needs to be 
                    multiplied by the number out so that you can compare FG counts.
                    
                    For this job, the 8 out is being used as the multiplier, even though there is only a small portio
                    n of the large board  used.  The calculation should look at the number up for the individual mate
                    rial type.

                    Cost = 5 Pallets x $30  = $150
                    However, Minimum Rate = $200 so cost will be $200.

                    This is often caused by a missing start or close date on the job.  
                    If a single job is being viewed in JR3, ignore the date range.

                    Problem occured when there were 2 of the same material on the job.
                    One had a blank UOM for the actual qty.  
                    Then the program was converting the quantity to the blank UOM and the conversion program accepted
                     the blank for some reason.
                    Modified the program so that it would not run the quantity conversion of the UOM was blank.

J-R-5-   04021411 B Closed Job Analysis - selling price is incorrect
                    Selling price is greatly inflated for all items sold by the case.  It takes the case price and mu
                    ltiplies it by the piece quantity and then the contribution is ridiculous.
                    Report should be fixed so that it will check for the unit of measure an item is sold by and do th
                    e math for the correct selling price.

                    Task# 09051405 was to Add MSF as a Field.
                    MSF is not printing.
                    MSF = Finished Goods Invoiced x Components Qty/Set x Square Feet in I-F-1 Totals Tab  divided by 
                    1000.   This is the FG Item on the report line.  ie. component in this example.
                    Print Job 206186. 
                    This has two Board, but both are used to make the final Set.
                    Assembled Sets are Invoiced as a finished product.
                    However, board is issued by the S/B component.  The qty/set must be multiplied by the Set Qty Inv
                    oiced. 
                    FG Item Miller Ale-02 is Qty/Set = 5, so 1000 sets x 5 = 5000 Received
                    FG Item Miller Ale-03 is Qty/Se t= 3, so 1000 Sets x 3 = 3000 Received
                    1) Change Current MSF Selected Field to FG MSF.
                         This is the FG Set Invoice Qty x Qty per Set x the FG components Square Ft from IF1 Totals
                    2) Add new Feild called RM MSF
                        MSF is per Sheet per FG item on the reports line.  ie.  Component
                        Form 2 issued 1,250 200B sheets for Component 2 (Miller Ale-02) = 1.111 MSF
                        Form 3 issued 250 200 B sheets for component 3 Miller Ale-03 = 2.5 MSF  
                    3)  FG Invoiced is per Set Component  = Sets Invoiced x the Qty/Set.
                           Assembled Sets are Invoiced as a finished product.
                    However, board is issued by the S/B component.  The qty/set must be multiplied by the Set Qty Inv
                    oiced. 
                    FG Item Miller Ale-02 is Qty/Set = 5, so 1000 sets x 5 = 5000 Received
                    FG Item Miller Ale-03 is Qty/Se t= 3, so 1000 Sets x 3 = 3000 Received

                    Estimate was SBS18 which Purchase and Stock UOM = TON and Vend Cost = $35 MSF
                    Real Board has Purchase UOM = Ton, Stock UOM = Lf and Vend Cost = $35 MSF.
                    See ASI Job W8823.   For Estimate 8823 which uses SBS18.
                    This Estimate has 2 out for Roll Width of 43.50.  Since Die Up is 2x3 the Total Job#Up = 12.
                    SBS18 has Vend Cost as $35 MSF but Purchase UOM and Consumption UOM = TON
                    Click SHT Calc and Selet SBS18-44 and Cost Correctly Converts to .1269 LF.
                    Likewise, Click SHT Calc and select SBS18-22 and the MRP, Cost and #up Properly Change.
                    The #up is 6, Sheets doubles from 9783 to 19566 and cost is converted to .0634.
                    HOWEVER,  
                    Click Materials and select SBS18 and press UPDATE button.
                    Change the board from SBS18  to SBS18-22 and the LF calcualte is WRONG.
                    The program should recalclate Cost, MRP and # Up.
                    It should match the Sht Calc Program.
                    Sheets would Doulbe to 19,566 so Cost per LF would be .0634 and $ Up should be 6.
                    Please Note,
                    The Program converts to the Real Boards Consumption UOM using the Mat'l Cost/M FG's.
                    Mat'l Cost/M Finished Goods  =  Materials Cost/M  x Job Qty/1000

                    The estimate shows 2 out on Gross Sheet and 6 Up on the Die.
                    Please note, 
                    If I select SBS18-22 this will double the MRP Sheets and cut number out to 6.
                    This will also change the cost per LF
                    If I select SBS18-44, the MRP sheet and #up will remain the same.
                    However the $35/MSF will be converted to .1269 per MSF.

                    See Attached.  
                    A negative Qty/Set must Divide the Set Quantity on the Job.
                    For example, Estimate 11911.
                    We are procuding Die Cut Pads that are 24 x 12.
                    We are packing 100 PADS per Shipping Container.
                    The Shipping / Packing Container is noted as a QTY/SET with a Negative Number.
                    In this estimate the Qty/Set = -100.
                    For for every 100 Sets (In this example, just pads)  we need 1 Packing Case.
                    Order/Job@  208032 is for 10,000 Sets.
                    This will require The Set Qty / 100  =  10,800 / 100 = 108 Shipping Containers.
                    BUG is as Follows:
                    FARM Tab is showing 10,800 x -100 = -1,080,000
                    Change Math for negative qty/set to DIVIDE.

M-F-1-   11261403 E HISTORY to Display A/P Invoiced Status with Update with Security Acces
                    Raw Materials History Tab new A/P Invoice Status.
                    This new field can be updated by the User ID ASI or users with security via the Program Master.  
                     This will allow ASI and customers to corect the database if a bug in the V-U-1 program improperl
                    y updates the RM History table.
                    Business Reason for this Logic.
                    When RM Receipts are posted, the A/P Invoice# and/or Status is updated in the RM History database
                    .   This logic is used when adding an A/P invoice from a purchase order.
                    Somehow,  purchase orders with multiple lines are showing the wrong status.
                    For example, 1 PO Line is received and Invoice.
                    However, the 2 PO Line item is received but the user cannot add the A/P Invoice.
                    The warning on the V-U-1 Invoice line tab states "No PO Avaialbe"

                    This will list many Tags for this PO.
                    However each tag will only have just ONE Receipt.
                    Therefore each tag would have the same date for the First Receipt and the Last Receipt.
                    This NEW logic must search by VENDOR PO#.
                    The First Receipt would be 8/22/13

                    The Receipt Qty appears to be repeating the total received quantity for each receipt line in the 
                    report.  This column should show the actual receipt qty.
M-R-5-   03121406 B N-K Report - New M-R-5 - PO Qty total not accurate
                    When you select Subtotal PO#/Item#, the total for PO Qty is not correct when there are more than 
                    one tag/transaction for a given Po Order line.
                    To test, run new MR5 with the following parameters:
                    Item: 200B-30x60
                    Beginning Date: 01/01/2014  Ending Date: 12/31/2015

                    Receipts - checked.
                    Notice there are 3 detail lines on the report.  The PO qty was 125 for that item.  The subtotal t
                    riples that amount since there were 3 separate receipts of 100 each with a total of 300 total (th
                    is is correct - do not change this).  The over/under of 140% is also correct since the order was 
                    for 125 and 300 were received.
                    The total of 375 shoudl really be 125.  We need logic to only add one po order line qty for a a g
                    iven po order line (unique item&job).
                    NOTE:  this works perfectly when there are multiple JOBS on a PO for the same item.  Each job wou
                    ld have its own po order line and would sum appropriately.

                     is not getting incremented through the sequence.
                    
                    
                    for each rm-rcpth where r-no ge 265206 no-lock by r-no desc:

M-U-1-   12301403 B Program fails when quantity entered is zero
                    Add a new receipt and leave quantity blank. Press  'Save' and program displays a message and corr
                    ectly takes you to the quantity column to correct. 
                    1) If you enter a quantity and save, other validations incorrectly report an invalid entry
                    2) If you cancel instead, you get a progress message that the rm-rctd is not available
M-U-2-   07031405 B Allow issue of estimated material in MU2
                    MU2 currently validates the RM item to ensure that it is an "R" material.
                    ACPI tags and tracks their estimated material.  
                    The error message: "Item is not on file. Do you want to add it? " comes up.  
                    This isn't a valid message since the item is on file,
                    
                    This does not appear to be a problem with SS Issuing.
                    
                    This change allows both R material and estimated material to be issued manually.

                    The M-U-6 program must validate M-F-1 Bins Tab for Total On Hand when posting MU2 Issues.   When 
                    M-F-1 Inventory Tab - Stocked Field is Checked.
                    M-U-6 Post Program should display Warning Message
                    Quantity Issued is greater than Bins On Hand + Unposted Issues.  
                    Then it Will not Allow me to Post.
                    Please update Issues.

                    I then Click I-F-1 History Tab and changed on Hand for Tag#1 to 40 Pounds.
                    Then clicked Inventory and Recalculated so Bin showed 40 On Hand.
                    Next, I clicked M-U-6
                    I immediately got Warning message that Tag had insufficent quantity on Hand.
                    That is because 40 are on hand and 50 were on the Issue.
                    Thats Beautiful
                    HOWEVER, the Bug then
                    Allowed me to Post a qty of 50 when only 40 were on Hand.
                    Net Result was -10 on hand for Tag#1.
                    
                    If M-F-1 Inventory Tab - Stocked Field is UnChecked then Inventory Can be Negative.

                    Every line of the Bill of Lading will always be set to C for Completed.  
                    Therefore, a back order release will never be created.

O-B-1-   10131405 B Delete of Invoice for Unassembled Sets doesn't remove releases
                    Invoices for Unassembled Sets are special in that they automatically add OT1 and OU1 releases for
                     the set header.  This is done to track the qty of the set header that has been shipped (which is
                     really the quantity of the # of full sets that can be made from the components that have shipped
                     thus far).
                    The problem is that if you delete an OB1 invoice for a set header, the OT1 and OU1 releases that 
                    are automatically created are not removed.  this can cause problems in that it throws off the nex
                    t calculation of what has already been shipped. 
                    Problem in Premier Live:
                    See BOL# 452148

                    emoved from the ASI system to start over.
                    
                    User blaidlaw was posting invoices from the OB4 and the other user dcormier was in the IF1 area (
                     see screen shots below)
                    
                    I can see that we happened to access the same FG# at the time but the fact that we both locked up
                     and one had to decide to cancel since waiting would not resolve anything?
O-B-4-   05291402 E cXML Processing  - Order Entry, ASN, & Invoicing
                    NOTE: This mod includes the previously quoted mod for the Invoice piece only (#12131306).
                    This mod will enable receipt of orders through cXML and transmission of cXML Advance Ship Notices
                     (ASN) and cXML Invoices.  Specs on required cXML formats are attached.
                    ASN & Invoice:
                    cXML Invoice generation is triggered by Premier user.  A new interface will be created that allow
                    s specifying a date range of invoices for a given customer. 
                    ASN piece would also be triggered by Premier user when the user prints a BOL (first time only, no
                    t reprint).  This would only execute special cXML handling if the customer is activated in an NK1
                     (cXMLASN. - View Form per customer)
                     - In both cases, this would generate a cXML file with a file name that indicates customer, data 
                    type and run date. 
                     - The cXML data that would then be pushed/transmitted to customer based on instructions stored i
                    n an NK1 for each customer. (cXMLASN & cXMLInvoice)
                     - There would be a log kept of transmissions.
                    Order Import piece:
                     - Assumption:  This is for stock item orders only.  No jobs will be automatically created.
                     - Receipt of the cXML would be a push from customer (Ariba) to an ASI/Premier web-service.  This
                     push would trigger the import process without any user interaction. 
                     - Similar to OEImport, orders come in to the system into O-W for approval.  
                     - The information in the cXML for the order should override any pricing in the system.  This wou
                    ld only apply to the individual order and should not affect the price matrix.
                     - ShipTo information needs to be added dynamically if the shipto ID provided is not already a va
                    lid ASI shipto.  If the shipto ID already exists in ASI, the new address information should be up
                    dated.
                     - Scheduled release would be created with the appropriate shipto ID.
                     - Change & cancellation orders would not affect ASI directly.  These will be handled by generati
                    ng an email detailing the change/cancellation.
O-B-4-   10061401 E cXML Processing  - Lookup Shipto tax code based on state
                    When ShipTos are automatically created, they are importing the tax code from the default shipTo (
                    this is the Shipto with the same ID as the Customer Number - DSG for instance).
                    This mod will add an additional lookup to the tax code table to attempt to find a match of the Sh
                    ipto State.
                    If a Tax Group is found that matches the State code, that will be used as the Tax Code on the new
                     shipTo.  Otherwise, the Tax Code will use the default as it does today (Note:  if Premier wants 
                    this to fall back to INT, that is what should be used on the default ShipTo).
                    
                    Change to above:
                    Instead of using the STATE Abbreviation as the tax code, the system will look for an existing shi
                    pto from the same state and use the tax code specified on that shipto.
O-B-4-   10211409 E cXML Processing  - cXMLASN Integer Val = 1 - generate on reprint only
                    If integer value of cXMLASN is 1, generate the ASN cXML.  Integer value 0 will still process on f
                    irst print only.
                    NOTE: The integer value must be set at the VIEW FORM level (customer specific) in the NK1.

                    See attachment - 
                    Example use invoice in OB1 for CANA1000, invoice# 7279
                    Example:  On our Invoice 193425 it prints the taxes as 46.50 GST and 92.77 PST (which is 
                    correct 5% + 9.5% tax on tax) but on the invoice posting register it shows 48.02 GST and 91.25 PS
                    T (but the the total is the same 139.27).  The amounts from the register are the ones updated to

O-F-3-   02051403 B Missing one of the price matrix records.
                    Please review this document I created on how to use the price matrix import /export function you 
                    and I hammered out in October.  When I imported my data I got the below message saying there was 
                    an error.  The import seemed to work just fine but it was missing one of the price matrix records
                    .  It also made all of the records have the same effective date of 9/26/2011.  This is the COXCO 
                    customer under our test database.  I have attached the exported file and the only one it left out
                     was a duplicate entry (COXCO20323).  The entry did have a different effective date and is theref
                    ore necessary.  We would want those prices to remain until the new effective prices take place.  
                    In the attached file there are 7 records and in the screen below there are only 6.  I went throug
                    h the exercise again updating a single record effective date to 02/04/2014 and it would not take 
                    it.  It made that record also say 9/26/2011.  I missed this in our previous tests but this is bro

                    New N-K-1 cXMLShipToParse - Character value
                    This only applies at the View Form/Customer specific level.
                    The Character Value per customer will identify any prefix that needs to be trimmed before auto cr
                    eating the shipTo on order import.  Additionally, this prefix will need to be re-applied to the S
                    hipTo when creating the cXML files to be transmitted back to Ariba.
                    For example, if Shipto is "DICKS:00001", the system will parse the DICKS: prefix and load the shi
                    pto in the ASI system as 00001.  Additionally, when building the cXML for ASN, Invoices and Ackno
                    wledgements, the ShipTo ID must be added to the "Contact" segment with the Prefix added.
                    Example:

                    O-L  LEVY Returns is a Return Authorization and returning goods that were previously shipped.
                    (See Attached)
                    (First click O-Q-2 and Type Invoice 7090 then click the BOL Folder Tab)
                    (This will show the Tags that were shipped for this invoice)
                    They are the only tags that can be returned as we cant Return Inventory that never shipped)
                    F1 shows the Tags On Hand.
                    F1 should show only Tags that were shipped.
                    To TEST
                    Click O-L
                    Add Return for Invoice 7090
                    The Invoice 7090 in the Account Receivable History fill will show that bill of Lading shipped Tag
                    # ending with 00509.    
                    The F1 Lookup on the Tags should only show the items shipped on the Bill of Lading for the Invoic
                    e that.

                    Add Return for customer ATT1000 for Invoice#  7256 for Order 207283
                    This is for 4 tags for total of 200,000 boxes.
                    However the selection only allows 1 tag.
                    
                    1)  Allow multiple tags per Return Authorization
                    2)  Tag Selection can be Blank or must match the Tags on BOL for Invoice
                    3)  F1 on Tags should only show Tags from BOL for that Invocie.
                    4)  Shipment Transaction Qty should equal the Return Qty.
                          For example Tag 20698 was 50 Units at 500 per Unit = 25,000.
                          Return cannot exceed  INVOICE Qty of 200,000.
                    5)  Posting Return creates a Return Transaction under I-U-1 Receipts.
                         This should retain the unit count from the BOL's Shipment transaction.

O-R-13  07071407 E OR13 BackLog report - Toggle Boxes = Shipped Value ___   Invoiced Valu
                    See attached documents two pages.
                    When an order is INVOICE only, the OR13 does not reduce the backlog value because nothing has shi
                    pped.  That logic is pefect and will not be changed.
                    Currently, the O-R-13 backlog report calculates the backlog based on Quantity Orders less Qty Shi
                    pped.  However, Invoice Only Releases are not considered as zero quantity has shipped.
                    1)  The Solution is a new New Toggle box called 
                          Sales Value?  Shipped Value    ____     This is the Current Logic is Value by Order Qty.
                                                       Invoiced Value  ______.
                    New logic when checking Invoice Qty will substract the Invoiced Qty times Sell Price (Invoiced Sa
                    les)  from the Order Value Sales (Order Qty x Selling Price).
                    2)  The HM1 Report, the Excel Speadsheet called Sales F/C uses the OR13 report.
                          This should be changed to use the new O-R-13 Toggle Box option called Invoice Qty
                    TESTING

                         a)  Expand OR13 Print Parmeter for Item# to view 15 characters.
                         b)  Sales Value incorrect per attached.  Qty Due/1000 x Sales price = Backlog Value
                               For new Invoice Value 
                              Order 207650 = 25,000 Ordered  less 25,000 Invoice Only = ZERO DOLLARS
                              Order 207653 = 24,000 less 15,000 invoiced x $193.49/M  = $1741.41

                    Task 07071407 added in Toggle Box to Show Invoiced Value.
                    The calculate is to take the Order Qty Value less the Invoiced Value for Backlog Value.
                    Invoice Only releases will lower this value.
                    HM1 uses the OR13 report and this new logic should be used in HM1.
                    
                    Problem is that I do not know how to Test.
                    The HM1 Report, the Excel Speadsheet called Sales F/C uses the OR13 report.
                    This should be changed to use the new O-R-13 Toggle Box option called Invoice Qty
                    Ordered 50,000, Invoice Only for 25,000 and Backlog value was perfect = $5,000
                    But, I ran HM1 for June 17,2014 which was Invoice Only date and I do not see any Value.

                    Currently, there is a column called "Routing" that will print the routing for orders with jobs.
                    This mod will additionally print a routing for orders without jobs by:
                    1)  Find the FG item
                    2)  Find the estimate from the FG Item,
                    3)  Find the most recent job for that estimate
                    4)  Pull the routing from that job

                     - Add a column called "OH - Rel Qty" 
                    This is the difference between the existing Total Qty OH and Rel Qty columns 
                    (Total Qty OH - Rel Qty).  
                    
                    Note, the calculation of these quantities is subject to user changes through the "Print OH qty" r
                    adio buttons and release selections. 
                    
                     - Add a toggle check box called ____"Only Neg OH-RelQty?".  
                    When checked, this will not display any rows of data that have a Qty Remaining that is greater th
                    an or equal to 0.  They would like to use this view to show the list of items that need to be add
                    ressed.
                    
O-R-2-   11171403 E N-K REPORTS ViewForm = OR2 - Add addtitional date columns
                    Add the following columns to the new OR2 Report with selectable columns (N-K Reports > View Form 
                    OR2 Logical Value = Yes):
                    1. Samples Ship Date  - this is defined as the release date (R) minus the number of calendar days
                     specified in the new A-F-1 ShipTo "Samples" field (N)  => R - N
                    
                    2. Dock Appt. Date  - this is defined as the release date (R) minus the number of calendar days s
                    pecified in the new  A-F-1 ShipTo "Dock Appt." field (P)  => R - P
                    
                    3. Earliest Ship Date -  this is defined as the release date (R) minus the number of calendar day
                    s specified in the new A-F-1 ShipTo"Earliest Allowed" field (C) =>  R - C
                    
                    4. Latest Ship Date - this is defined as the release date (R) plus the number of calendar days sp
                    ecified in the new A-F-1 ShipTo "Latest Allowed" field (D) = > R + D
                    
                    Important:  A ShipTo is not defined until a Scheduled Release is created.  This happens automatic
                    ally when you add an order item, but not until that order item is saved.  Also, it is possible to
                     have multiple Scheduled Releases going to different ship to locations.  This mod will use the *F
                    irst* Scheduled Release to determine the ship to location to use for the values of M,N,P,C and D 
                    .
                    
                    Note:  See attached document for how this mod fits in with other mods.  Mod # 08121405 is require

                    Running the OR2 report for this order (check off Bill Of Lading) shows a release date of 12/11/20
                    14.  This is incorrect.  It should show 12/25/2014

                    This is the Warehouse on the Bill of Lading.
                    For each Invoice, find the Bill of Lading Number, then Find the Warehouse on the Bill of Lading.
                    This is the SHIP FROM warehouse.
                    1)  Invoice Post will transfer the Ship From Warehse to the Accounts Receivable History File.
                         If needed, the BOL Post will transfer to the O-B-1 BOL file.
                    2)  OR6 Report will transfer Wareshouse directly from the A/R History File 
                    3)  If Options 1 & 2 Above Require Less than 5 Hours,

                    For each Item on an invoice, we must find the bill of lading number for each finished good item, 
                    then find the Warehouse on the bill of lading line..
                    It is possible to have multiple warehouse locations on 1 or more bill of ladings.
                    Invoices can be created by PO# or by Date Group.
                    This means that multiple bill of ladings can be combined to create 1 invoice.
                    That single invoice may have shipped from different warehouses.
                    Program will only print the first Warehouse from the first BOL for each invoice line when ,

O-S-1-   01241407 B N-K BOLFMT = ACCORDBC - Print page numbers on BOL.
                    Is there a way we can have page #'s  print on our ACCORDBC BOL?  Pick Tickets seem to have them o
                    n there, but our BOL's don't. 
                    
                    This was originally copied from XPrint which does print the page numbers.  Please print page numb
                    ers on ACCORDBD exactly like they are done in XPrint.

                    Customer is getting a error message  when printing to port directly.  
                    The code file was missing the TMP code line for the bolrfc.r file.
                    
                    Cannot locate the TMP file when printing.

                    New Excel template-based certificate form built to the attached spec.
                    3C has provided Excel file/template in desired format, and provide field definitions.
                    See attached .xlsx file.  This should be converted to an .xltx to be used in the BOLCERT output.

O-S-1-   02211401 B BOL split into multiple invoice lines
                    On the first item Daiichi invoice issue, you can see that on the BOL there is a single line item,
                     however on the invoice for said item it is split into 2 lines for some reason.
                    
                    On the dsm invoice issue a-lot you can see from the BOL that there were two lines both on the sam
                    e BOL # yet there were 2 separate invoices generated by this single BOL.
                    
                    On the dsm invoice issue b-lot you can see two separate lines on both the BOL and the invoice. Th
                    is item printed correctly.
                    From Brad:
                    The good thing in this case is that this doesn?t appear to be a ?Group by Date? situation.
                    What I?ve found so far is that the first invoice ?daiichi invoice?? has 2 ar-invl records. So it
                     looks like the issue where things are divided happens upstream from the invoice print process, (
                    BOL Posting maybe).
                    I also know that 3C uses Customer Lot# quite a bit and that is a reftable tied to several order p
                    rocessing tables. Oe-rel oe-rell oe-boll, etc. Could be an issue with that and maybe a rogue re
                    c_key.
                    
                    Basically, 2 questions to answer:
                    1.	Why does the first single line BOL split out into 2 lines on the same invoice?
                    2.	Why does the second 2 line BOL (2 different lot numbers?) split out into two separate invoices
                    ?
                    
O-S-1-   03041402 B BOL split into multiple invoice lines
                    Colonial BOL 115925:
                    When this BOL is posted it results in 3 Invoice lines, when only 2 are desired.
                    1 line should be the TAILGATE lot number
                    1 line should be the rest of the order/billable items.
                    
                    The data condition that caused this was a blank reftable with a blank lot-no that was tied to one
                     of the bol lines.  
                    
                    Two possible fixes:
                    1) Prevent the creation of this blank lot-no reftable
                    2) Ignore this blank reftable when running the code that divides up the invoice lines as per N-K 
                    INVLOTLINE logical value = Yes.
                    
O-S-1-   03041407 B Merging a BOL does not show full list of BOL lines
                    When two BOL's exist for the same Shipto.
                    ASI Logic allow to combine items by changing the BOL to match an existing BOL number.
                    This does not Refresh the Screen.
                    User must  must exit out of OS1 (or re-run the main query on the Browse tab) to see the new merge
                    d BOL header with multiple lines.
                    
                    Solution is Immediate Refresh.
                    This fix should display all BOL lines for merged BOLs for the BOL header that is being editted (i
                    .e. BOL number changed to another) immediately once the merge has completed, thus giving them imm
                    ediate positive feedback that the merge was successful.
                    
O-S-1-   03101402 B Partial Releases changing Status to P

                    Add Order for 1000 boxes.
                    Create Two Releases for 250 Each.
                    The BOL is set to a P(partial) because it is only part of the original blanket order. 
                    They change to C because the customer asked for 250 and we ship 250.
                    
                    The problem is  when the customer calls and asks for another 250 the following day. 
                    Original BOL has not yet been posted to an Invoice.
                    The New Release arrives in the BOl.
                    The Original Release changes from P to C changes back to a P again.

O-S-1-   04171407 B Freight by Pallet Calculate Wrong BOL Freight Cost
                    A-F-8  Carrier = TRUCK for Main Plant.
                    This checked to calculate Freight by the Pallet
                    Zone 100 is $30 per Pallet but a Minumum Charge of $200.
                    BOL freight is not correct.
                    When shipping pallets with Tags, each BOL Line is calculating with a Minimum Charge.
                    A BOL is 1 Shipment.  
                    Each Line is 1 Pallet.
                    The Total charge for All BOL lines is compared to the Minium.
                    The Minimum is ONLY used if the Total Pallet Charge is under the Minimum Charge.
                    
                    The MINIMUM pallet charge will be become the TOTAL Charge.
                    Hence, this Total Charge will be divided by total pallets to equal the Charge per BOL Line.
                    
                    For Example.
                    Cutomer HEW1000 in Shipto File uses the TRUCK and Zone 100.
                    The A-F-8 shows $30 per Pallet with Minimum of $200.
                    BOL# 7697 for Order 207110 has two Tags.
                    Freight shows $50.
                    This should show $200.
                    
                    Please note, 1 Tag = 1 Pallet.
                    Minimum charge is based on all Pallets for All Items

                    We have noticed since the patch that when you are in O-S-1 picking bins on a bill of lading that 
                    when you are on an item?say the third line down..after you pick the bin for that line item it rev
                    erts back to line number 1.  It is aggravating when you have 10 items on the BOL.  You have to sc
                    roll down after each select bin.  This did not work like this in the past.

                    After Select Bins/Tags on the BOL screen, the active line used to be the *next* item on the BOL. 
                     It is better than it was before where it was reverting back to the first line, but we need it to
                     do what it did before.  User should be able to hit Select Bins, do their selection, then hit the
                     Select Bins again, without having to select the next line item.
                    From customer:
                    We are getting closer on the BOL and picking bins.  In the past when you picked the bin and click
                    ed on OK it would go to the next line item on the BOL.  Now it is staying on the line that you ju

                    Override Freight Cost must prorate Total Freight for each BOL Line.
                    To Test
                    Order 207614, I created BOL for Hew-8x8x8 and selected 5 tags.

                    When shipping pallets with Tags, each BOL Line is calculating with a Minimum Charge.
                    The Minimum is ONLY used if the Total Pallet Charge is under the Minimum Charge.
                    For Example.
                    Cutomer HEW1000 in Shipto File uses the TRUCK and Zone 100.
                    The A-F-8 shows $30 per Pallet with Minimum of $200.
                    BOL# 7697 for Order 207110 has two Tags.
                    Freight shows $50.
                    This should show $200.

O-S-1-   09261401 B Freight by Pallet on BOL lines Not Calculated
                    Must Calcualte BOL Lines when Overridding Freight Cost.
                    Task# 04171407 removed this logic, but BOL lines is what moves to the Invoice.
                    Override Freight Cost must prorate Total Freight for each BOL Line.
                    
                    To Test
                    Order 207614, I created BOL for Hew-8x8x8 and selected 5 tags.
                    A-F-8  Carrier = TRUCK for Main Plant.
                    This checked to calculate Freight by the Pallet
                    Zone 100 is $30 per Pallet but a Minumum Charge of $200.
                    When shipping pallets with Tags, each BOL Line is calculating with a Minimum Charge.
                    The Minimum is ONLY used if the Total Pallet Charge is under the Minimum Charge.
                    For Example.
                    Cutomer HEW1000 in Shipto File uses the TRUCK and Zone 100.
                    The A-F-8 shows $30 per Pallet with Minimum of $200.
                    BOL# 7697 for Order 207110 has two Tags.
                    Freight shows $50.
                    This should show $200.
                    
                    Please note, 1 Tag = 1 Pallet.
                    Minimum charge is based on all Pallets for All Items 
O-S-1-   10241407 B ADD button must import RELEASE#
                    ADD button should import the existing Release# for the FG Item selected.
                    Currently, ADD does not import a release#.
                    Then when the BOL is posted, the Invoice is missing those BOL Lines.
                    Major Issue.
                    
                    Only tricky issue.

                    Click SELECT BIN/TAGS button.
                    This should exclude customer owned from the Bins/Jobs Tab on the Popup Screen.
                    This is any line with the Customer Code in the Bin/Jobs File.
                    
                    The program should not allow a customer code listed on the BOL lines for a SHIP ONLY release.  Th
                    is will incorrectly deduct from customer owned inventory.
                    The program must deduct REAL inventory when posting bill of lading.
                    The Customer Owned TRANSFER  is automatically posted by the program when the SHIPMENT occurs.
                    
                    Task is to Exclude Bins with Customer# if release is Ship Only.
                    See BOL# 7467  (See Attached for Order 207295)
                    The Release# on BOL shows a status of S for Ship Only.
                    The SELECT BIN/TAGS button should not allow selecting the Bin with Customer ATT1000.
                    This is a customer owned Bin.

O-S-5-   01221406 B SHIP Only Release not Updating BINS/JOB folder
                    SHIP ONLY releases create the Transfers Perfectly when the Bill of Lading is Posted..
                    However, the S Transaction in History is not updating the BOL bins/Tags.
                    If I ship a specific Tag, that must be posted to the History and Subtracted from the BIn Table.
                    The SHIP transactions in History must match the The BOL data and Bin Tables.
                    For Example.   See Attached 
                    ASI Order 207295 for finished goods item Bubble 1.25"
                    Bill of Lading shows tag ending 0001.
                    The BOL Tab on the Invoice shows the tag# BUBBLE 1.25"   00001.
                    However,
                    When the BOL is posted, the HISTORY tab shows no Tag Number for the Shipment.
                    Also, the Bin/Jobs Table is not updated.
                    This makes inventory completely wrong.
                    The Tag# BUBBLE 1.25"   00001 was shipped, but not substracted from the BIN/Jobs Tab.
                    The Program should not create a Transfer with a Blank Tag# is the BOL has Tag#'ss
                    Please note, If a JOB# exists, the program works perfectly for manufactured jobs.
                    It appears to be a bug for items without a job#.
                    Ship only Releases must create the SHIP transaction with the BOL data including Tag#.

                    Test with Customer TACOBELL with Shipto Code TACOJOES.
                    TacoBell has a Sales Rep = 001.
                    TacoJoes is a Shipto Code for Taco Bell with a Sales Rep = CMB.
                    Logical Value = NO.    This is the existing Logic.
                    This willl transfer the Customer Sales Rep Field to the Estimate and to the Order.
                    And this will also transfer to the Orders ITEMS tab.
                    Logical Value = YES.   New Database Field will be aded to the Shipto File.
                    This willl transfer the new Sales Rep Field from the Ship to File to the Estimate.
                    Therefor, this  transfers the new Sales Rep from the Estimate if order has an Estimate.
                    This will transfer the new Sales Rep from ShipTo file when FG Item on Order has no Estimate.
                    Once ITEMS tab has new Sales Rep, Commissions Logic will calculate for that Rep.
                    Existing Logic will then transfer the Sales Rep from Order Line to the Invoice when BOL is Posted
                     so that the invoice will be sent to TACO BELL but for TACOJOES sales Rep.
                    
                    Please note,  This will not handle multiple shiptos on a single order.
                    Program will only transfer 1 Sales Rep to the Items Tab.

                    When posting in O-S-5 the time would take about 45 seconds or longer to post.  
                    This started to happen after the last patch that was sent to Color carton.  
                    Dale explained that the posting was only taking about 5 seconds before that last patch date.
                    This is happing with one BOL.

                    The FG item 4x4x4 has a sell price UOM = L for Lot Pricing.
                    The Invoice Quantity on the O-B-1 Invoice Items tab shows ZERO quantity invoiced.
                    The O-B-1 View Invoice screen shows the Invoice Revenue that is Wrong.
                    
                    The Bill of Lading is creating the Invoiced Revenue for items with UOM = L.
                    Ship Only releases should not have an Invoiced Dollar Amount.
                    
                    Please note,
                    Misc Charges will still be billed with the first shipment.
O-S-5-   09291404 B BOL Posting Should not Delete Bins
                    Posting Bill of Lading is deleting Bins.
                    The I-F-1 Bins file now has a Toggle Box to Hide Bins with Zero on Hand.
                    The Tag# / Bins should remain in the Bins File.
O-S-5-   10021404 B Invoice Posting of Invoice Only should not update I-F-1 Qty Allocated
                    See Attached.   Issue with BOL/INV Button for Invoice Only
                    Allocated = Ordered less Shipped.
                    Invoice Only is not a Shipment.
                    However, this substracts from the Allocated Quantity when the Invioce is Created.
                    The result is the I-R-1 Report when printed as ALLOCATED uses the wrong Allocated Qty.
                    ASI Order 207947 is for 500,000 boxes.
                    The I-F-1 should show Ordered less Shipped.
                    It appears to include transfers from an Invoice Only.
                    Please note,
                    The N-K-1 OEShipFrom logical Value = YES.
                    The quantity allocated in the I-F-1 Bins tab by warehouse is perfectly showing 550,000.
                    That includes 300,000 in Main Warehouse and 250,000 in NJ Warehouse.
                    If the I-R-1 Report is printed by Warehouse, the Allocated Qty totals 550,000.
                    When I-R-1 Report is printed with Toggle Box = Allocated 
                    and  ReOrder by Warehouse is UNCHECKED,  the Total ALL QTY Allocated shows ZERO.
                    This should show 500,000 which is Order Qty less Ship Qty.

                    When accessing the browser, the Release# Field should be in Focus.
                    The Cursor should immediately be on the Relese# Field waiting for Number.
                    This requires the User to click in a field before they can type.
                    If you review A-F-1 or any other program, the cursor is immediately placed on the 1st field.
O-T-1-   02121408 B N-K Relpost Int-val = 1 - Blocking posting when sufficient inventory
                    When N-K RELPOST IntVal = 1, an additional check is done on the release to test for insufficient 
                    inventory.
                    In the case of release 7229, this is blocking the posting of a release when it should be allowed.
                    First, if a release line has a tag, this extra inventory check should be skipped altogether. For 
                    inventory locations that are not tagged, the check can be made but must be fixed.
                    
                    The Release Printing and Post process, does this release check twice (oe/relcheckp).  The first t
                    ime there is not an exception thrown but the internal temp-table is retained in memory for the se
                    cond call to the program.  Because qtys are not reset to 0, inventory is flagged as insufficient 
                    and the posting is aborted.

                    There was existing Logic for O-T-3 based on the N-K-1 RelPrint Date Value.
                    Customer Complained.
                    When you go to O-T-3 the dates are always 01/01/0001 and 12/31/9999.
                    If you change the dates the next time you open it those dates should be in there.
                    New Logic for N-K-1 RelPrint  
                    DATE VALUE - Logical Value = YES.  
                    The date value is used as a default date for the O-T-3 release print screen. 
                    If the date is left blank here, then the user is forced to manually enter the date before printin
                    g release tickets. This is a good safe guard so that only release tickets print for one day at a 
                    time.    
                    However, the O-T-1 Icon will import the Release Date to both the TO and FROM dates.
                    DATE VALUE - Logical Value = NO.  The Date Values on the O-T-3 Screen are saved by User Id.

O-T-3-   08141403 B Reprint of Posted Releases in Range -> Blank Page
                    Blank Page prints when the "Reprint Posted Releases" option is checked.
                    This should do a reprint of the Posted Releases that pass the filter criteria.
                    Example.  
                    Print Customer ZOV100 to ZOV100
                    Date 6/20/14 to 6/20/14 (although this can be a larger range with same result)
                    All Release #s
                    All Order Numbers
                    All Ship From Whses
                    All Delivery Zones
                    Check Reprint Release Tickets and Reprint Posted Releases.
                    Blank page results.
                    Release #7956 should pass the criteria and be reprinted.  
                    In fact, if you set the release # to be 
                    7956 to 7956, the reprint is successful.
                    It needs to work when the Release # range is larger than just one release.
                    See OB1 invoice 7401.  For this invoice, the first line that currently prints should not print.  
                    All other lines should move up to below the header line starting at the location the 0 qty line p

                         Otherwise, Purchase Order Cannot be created. 
                    2)  ESC key will exit the screen.
                          X key and Cancel Key should work like the ESC Key
                    
                    3) PO Qty  on Purchase Order is Zero after Selecting an Vendor

                    ASI RESPONSE
                    Reason for Copy Logic Above.
                    RELEASE button on ITEMS tab combines all items on O-T-1 and transfers the Ship Notes.
                    Currently, the Only Ship Notes that will Transfer to O-T-1 are for the 3x3x3
                    That is the FG item is sequential Order.
                    It user adds New Ship Notes to any Item other than 3x3x3, the notes do not ship.
                    So Solution is the COPY notes to All Items Release Ship Notes.

                    O-U-1 Add Order.                     (See Attached)
                    Type Customer ATT1000
                    On Items Tab, click "HISTORY" button
                    This allows selecting multiple items by CHECKING the toggle Box on the Left for Each FG Item.
                    1)  Radio Button by ITEM at Bottom to Sort by FG item#  Does not work.
                          This is sorted by Order.
                          If I Click Order then Click Item#, then the List should sort by FG item.
                    2)  The Radio Button should be Saved by User ID.
                          If I click Item# and exist.  Next time I return to this screen, the list should be sorted b
                    y FG item.
                    
                    3)   Add Button called MOVE COLUMNS.
                          This will allow moving columns.
                          Clients would like to move the Sell Price next to the Sale Date.
                          Clients would like to move the Custmoer Part# next to the Item#.
                          This should work like other browsers such as raw goods M-F-1.
                           Save by User ID.
                    
                    4)  Add YELLOW columns to the Item# and Customer Part# fields.

                    O-U-1 release tab has the wrong release status for order 207292.  
                    I released each item one at a time.
                    I answered YES to merge each release with the existing Release.
                    Then I posted all together.
                    The BOL shows 1 BOL with 3 Items.
                    However,
                    Release Tab for Order Status of all 3 items should the 'P' but some are shown as 'A'.

                    All Items are displayed which is unfriendly.
                    
                    The AutoFind Box should default the the FG item highlighted on the ITEMS Tab.
                    In this example 8x8x8 should transfer to the AutoFind Box.
                    Only Items for 8x8x8 should display.
                    
                    Since this Order is for ATT1000.
                    All Matrixes for any other customer should not display.
                    The prices for 8x8x8 without a Customer should also display.

                    RELEASE Button should be disabled.
                    A warning Message would be OK but Ideally RELEASE button should be Disabled.
                    
                    BOL/INV button is the only valid button to process an Invoice Only Release which is an I on the S

                    As part of the mod to create the N-K OEDateChange, security was to be added to restrict the editi
                    ng of the Release Date in OU1 Release tab and OT1 Release header.
                    This security does not appear to be working as designed.
                    
                    If a user has access to update the Release Line in OU1 or edit the Release Header in OT1, the use
                    r must also appear on the OEDateChg "Update" field to be able to edit the Release date (and subse

                    This should be a second and specific layer of security to the Release Date field.
O-U-1-   05071403 B Farm Tab Costs are not Written to J-U-1 for ALL Jobs Types
                    My test, created order 207599, job 207599 from estimate 11692.
                    Job Tab was created.
                    Joes Test  
                    Job 207599 is $175 per MSF.
                    The Farm Tab shows this cost but does not recalcualte Set Cost per /M.
                    Thus the VIew Job Cost shows $9,038.1076 per M but the 
                    Farm Tab shows Set cost/M = $175/M  and Total Standard Cost are wrong at over 242,000/M
                    The SET Cost/M must be converted to Cost/M.
                    FARM MSF =  ((Sht W x L) / 144)) x  (MRP Qty / 1000)
                    FARM Set Cost/M  = (Total MSF x Farm Cost per MSF)   x ( Set Qty/1000)
                    In Summary.
                    Grand Total of Farm Cost / Set Qty x 1000  =  Farms Set Cost/M
                    Estimate Layout Tab shows sheet size of 60.10 x 122.02 = 60.625x122.125 = 7403.828 SqInches
                    Sheet MSF = 7403.828 / 144 = 51.415
                    MRP Qty = 25,000
                    TOTAL MSF = 25,000 / 1000  x 56.50  =1285 MSF 
                    Total Farm Cost = $175 x 1285  =  224,942.69
                    Set Cost/M  = $224,942.69 / 25,000 x 1000 = $8997.70

                    For example, if I type *Bubble*  all the bubble wrap will display.
                    
                    1) Add wild Card Search to Item#

                    Add the wild card to O-Q-1 Order Query
                    Add the wild card to O-U-6 Closed Orders 
                    
                    
                    PLEASE NOTE.
                    We still need to be able to search by mulitple fields.
                    For example Customer = Miller   and  Item# = *Miller*

O-U-1-   05161408 E N-K RELMERGE View Control = ShipFromWhse&SamePO#

                    Form Items Tab.  Click RELEASE button.
                    This would create two unique Release Numbers.
                    The box Items will be on the 1st  Release Number.
                    The bubble wrap will be on 2nd Release Number.

                    The order number 207580 prints twice on the Excel Output. 
                    The reason is because we added the Release Qty as a selectable field.
                    
                    1) Add new Toggle Box.
                         Print Detail by Release Date?
                         Yes will print as this currently prints.
                    
                         Print Detail by Release Date?  = NO.
                         Then this will only print one line per FG item per Order.  
                         This will only print the 1st Release. 
                         This was the Logic before making the programming change for Release Date.
O-U-1-   05281402 B Order Browser Does not Always Update Ship Quantity
                    The Ship Quantity must be a trigger that displays from the Release Tab.
                    The customer example was an order for mulitple stock items without job numbers.
                    The bill of lading was for same items but included the job numbers from stock jobs.
                    
                    After posting the Bill of Lading, many items showed ship quantity and others did not.
                    Simply by clicking the Release Tab this Correct Ship Qty then appeared on the browser.
                    We also have a utility called util/FxOEShip.r   will update all the Ship Qty fields.
                    
                    Customers needs to rely on Order Browser without extra steps.
                    For example.
                    Create order for 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6, 7x7x7 and ship jobs for each item.

                    Example on our system Order#207738
                    This is a combination estimate for 3 items on one Form.
                    I need to add Chocolate without an Estimate Number to this order.
                    This will be the similar to adding a Purchased Item.
                    Currently, we get a warning message that Item Exist.
                    This should allow adding items from the FG Item file.
                    This will not add to the Estimate.
                    Order 207627 is a Tandem Estimate which will allow adding items to the estimate.

                    Added Order 208086 for Estimate 11937
                    This is Tandem Esitmate with  10 Forms.
                    Farm Out  / Purchased Items of Form 1 and 9 and 10.
                    Raw mateials for the other forms.
                    The order Prompts to create a PO should be in order of the Form.
                    FG item then all the raw goods, then the two FG Items.
                    However, only the RM items is prompted.
                    Find Order 208086 for Estimate 11937
                    Click UPDATE and SAVE.
                    Forms 9 & 10 are never Prompted.
                    Also
                    When Integer Value = 1 for OEAutoPO and OEAuotFG
                    This prompts twice for each PO.
                    It appears to go through the loop for both NK1 Parameters.
                    In reality,  it should be 1 time for each PO only depending on the NK1

                          Press F1 on FG Item code and there is a radio button to search by Customer Part#.
                          This should be the same lookup for Customer Part#
                    PLEASE NOTE. 
                    The Lookup should first search the Totals/CP# table for a Customer.
                    For example, HEW1000 is listed and this should find HEW5x5x5.
                    If customer code matching BIllTo is not found.
                    Then search for Customer Part# in the I-F-1 file.
                    The Quote Table works this way.
                    Also, If you add an order for 5x5x5, the program will import HEW5x5x5

                    The PO# on the Items tab is for a FG item.
                    The FG Item I-F-1 shows that this is a Purchased FG.
                    The Estimate shows that this item is Purchased.
                    
                    The Loadtag Creation Screen must default to Purchsaed Receipt at the top Left.
                    The Job Number should not default to the Screen.
                    The Board PO# should transfer to the PO# Range.
                    
                    If I create Loadtag as a JOB.

                    However, If I update and tab, this Removes the Proper PO# and puts in the Job#.
                    That is Wrong as the PO will not show any received.

                    Now we need to update those fields.
                    1) F1 on FG Item Code on Misc Tab will only show FG items on the Order.
                         However, the User can Type a different FG item.
                    2)  When Adding a MISC charge, the FG item on the order should transfer.
                          If multiple FG Item are on the order, the program will Prompt to Select an Item.

                    O-U-1 Add Order for Estimate 11641
                    Create PO for Farm Out Foam and Fat Tire Lite-1.
                    1)  The Program SHOULD not transfer the Job# to the Vendor PO.
                          When Job# is transferred, the PO cannot be updated and the S/B is Invalid.
                    2)  The Job File FARM tab Cost imports the wrong cost when the Job# is on the IU1 Receipt

                           The JOB# transferrs from the PO#, because the JOB# is on the PO.
                    Then the cost posted to the FARM comes from the JOB.
                    The Cost should transfer from the PO.
                    See Job 207991.   This was via PO# 102712 for $125/M.
                    The FARM tab should show Actual Cost/M of $125/M and Actual Cost of $50
                    I received 1000 on I-U-1.  This Imporst both Job# and PO# and shows Error.
                    I delete Job# and Cost/M = $125.
                    Save button imports Job# and changes Cost to $250/M.

                    It looks pretty straightforward, leading me to believe that the query failed and the INVPRINT rec
                    ord was not there.  This is troubling.
                    The first part of the task would be in identifying how the sys-ctrl query could fail, other than 
                    the INVPRINT record not existing.  Bad "cocode"?
                    The second part of the task would be in identifying how to validate that no sys-ctrl records are 
                    deleted automatically by any code (load procedures, etc).

                    Create 1 Tag of 1000 Fat Tire Sets and create LoadTag that will posted immediately.
                    However, the Negative Adjustments for the Components were not created.
                    This is a MAJOR Bug.  
                    In fact, there would not be enough to produce 400 sets so that is a bug.
                    Please note, if there are insuffient components, the SET Receipt should not be created.
                    In this example, only 200 sets can be recieved.
                    There are not enough of componets to make 400 sets. 
                    Please note, if NK1 SSPostFG log value = NO, the componets are loaded perfectly.
                    Then the user has to POST manually.
                    NK1 SSPostFG Logical Value = YES, should create negative Adjustment but AUTOMATICALLY post.

                    2.  O-Z-5 is rounding all prices to 2 decimal places.  
                         This does not really impact items priced per M.

O-Z-5-   11101406 B OZ5 Issues - $0 Invoice lines and rounding error
                    OZ5 handles $0 invoice line items differently than OR6.  The example at Premier is below.
                    Additionally, there is loss of precision on the total sales calculation in OZ5 because the price 
                    is rounded to 2 decimal places.
                    Original email from Andy at Premier:
                    1.       Invoice 434288 (attached) only has one item that shipped and therefore only one item has
                     a sales price on the invoice.  The other 2 items should not be on either O-R-6 or O-Z-5.  Please
                     make sure both reports are only using invoice sales.
                    2.       Invoice 434593 (attached) has only one item with a sales price of $0.2865 each, resultin
                    g in an invoice total of $1,971.12.  This price and total should be the same on both O-R-6 and O-
                    Z-5.  Please stop O-Z-5 from rounding to decimal places.

P-T-C-H  08051405 B Pre-Patch Utility to Assess DB State
                    Problem:
                    There have been complaints that a "data reverted after a patch" on multiple occasions.
                    The only way I can imagine data gets changed during a patch event is if Progress runs a large "un
                    do" on the DB to protect the integrity of the DB.  This is the only thing I can think of that may
                     cause the type of reversion of data being reported.  To protect against this problem, we will wr
                    ite a utility program to alert us to any bad processes or running sessions prior to deploying the
                     patch.  
                    Solution:
                    Need a utility that will present a list of resolution steps before a DB is in a state that will a
                    llow for a Patch to be applied safely or for a DB to shutdown cleanly before a Delta is applied .
                    This utility will tell us what additional steps need to be taken to have the DB in a free and cle
                    ar state.  In our current process, John requires that everyone log out and waits for the go-ahead
                     from the customer before shutting anything down.  We will continue this with the additional requ
                    irement that this new utility must also indicate that we are "go".
                    Here are some checks that probably need to be done:
                     - Users still logged in
                     - Records still locked/transactions still occurring
                     - DB Extents running out of space
                    If everything is OK, the report should show "OK" next to each test it does.  If any test fails, i
                    t needs to instruct on what actions to take to resolve.
P-U-1-   02041408 B Initial cost wrong on new FG PO
                    When entering a new PO, the cost returned is wrong (off by 1000) when the following condition occ
                    urs:
                    FG Item Last cost > 0 
                    FG Item Purchase UOM = EA
                    FG Item Vend Cost UOM = M
                    and Vend Cost matrix is not defined or 
                    Vend Cost Matrix for Blank Vendor Matrix has all Matrix Quantitis = 0000000
                    ( This should be 99999999 as the first qty).
                    
                    To test:
                    Add PO for any vendor for FG "ZOV10x10x10"
                    The last cost for the Item is 965.59/M
                    However, when you tab out of the Item field, a cost of 965000+ /M is displayed.
                    Furthermore, when you change the qty, the cost is divided by the qty in M each time you leave the
                     qty field or the UOM field.

                    st of LOT, MSF, EA, M, etc.   Therefore the cost in the FG bin file is the cost that will transfe

                    for the Fat Tire Foam, which has no Order or Job# updated this field improperly.
                    The O-U-1 Order 207529 has a customer Po = FatTireLite.
                    This should never be transferred to FARM Tab in J-U-1.
                    Also, the Cost on the J-U-1 FARM Tab is Wrong.
                    It also shows $100,000's

                    2.  Go to the Items Folder

P-U-1-   04151403 B PO's not closing on board purchases
                    On Board purchases, about 30% of the time the po is not closing.
                    The PO number I provided to review was 6613. 
                    Every receipt has been invoiced, yet the PO did not close.
                    What makes a line item close and what makes a PO close?
                    
                    ASI Solution.
                    Receipt Qty withing Underun Qty will close line item of PO.
                    If Item is closed, A/P Invoice Qty = or greater then RM qty received will close PO.
                    Of course, this logic must apply to all lines on the PO.
                    
                    Logic was changed for this task in regards to estimated vs real materials.

                    Brad noted that there was a blank fg item record which he deleted.
                    Deleted the errant attachments and modified the attachment program to not create the attachments 
                    if the item number is blank.

                    Brad noted that there was a blank fg item record which he deleted.
                    ASI Solution
                    Deleted the errant attachments and modified the attachment program to not create the attachments 
                    if the item number is blank.
P-U-1-   06131407 B N-K POPrint = Xprint2 (4 decimal places)
                    See Attachment.   Add one more decimal place to the length and width so there is 4 digits to the 
                    right of the decimal.   
                    ASI Solution
                    N-K-1  POPrint
                    Decimal Value = .5 will print decimals on the Purchase order.
                    So  15 3/16 Inches will print  15.1875 
                    Decimal Value = .08 will print in 16ths on the Purchase order.
                    So  15 3/16 Inches will print  15.03
                    See New Attachment for Decimal Chart.   The Decimal Value dictates the format.
                    The changes made have destroyed the logic for printing in 16ths.
                    If Decimal Value = .08 this will only print two decimal digits 
                    EXACTLY like NK1 POPrint = XPrint
                    If the Decimal Value = .05 this should print in decimals.  Expand to 5 decimals.
                    3/16ths will- print     .1875
                    3/32 will print            .09375.
                    Do not print zeros at the end.  If dimension is 28.50  Iit will print 28.50   
                    It  Should Not  print 28.50000

                    1)  Change  Label from  Open PO   to    ___ UnPaid
                    2)  Change Label from   Closed PO to   ___  Paid 
                    3)  Place the  ___ Paid    ___ UnPaid   toggle boxes on the top.

                    4)  Add new Toggle Box called  _____  Closed

                          For example, status N for New,  Open,  U=Updated,  etc are all Open.
                    6)  Put the  ___ Open   ___ Closed   toggle boxes directly under the ___ Paid  ___ Closed.
                    
                    All four Toggle Boxes will work together to Limit the Lines that are displayed on the PO Browser.

                    ction by Due Date) Screen.
                    4. When checked, the Exclude credit card/ACH vendors toggle box must be unchecked..  Cannot have 
                    both checked.
                    5. When printing checks in VC1, If the ACH toggle box is checked, then use the Starting ACH Check
                     number field on bank file screen.
                    
                    If Toggle box is checked on VB1 Screen [Bill Pay Vendors Only], only pull up vendor invoices wher
                    e the vendor has the New [BillPay] toggle box checked in the vendor file.
                    
                    This should work exactly like the new [Credit Card/ACH Vendors Only] mod.
                    
                    When printing the checks for Bill Pay they will check the same toggle box For ACH checks and use 
                    the same check# range for ACH checks, but this code must be changed to check that the checks are 
                    billpay.

V-C-1-   03041401 B LOT Cost incorrect on A/P Invoice.
                    When we issue a PO with a LOT price and we attempt to input vendor invoice the system brings in t
                    he EA price and multiplies the quantity by this value until we update the filed appropriately.
                    
                    Below on PO 8165 we have a cost of 1050 LOT but when we create vendor invoice the EA price is sho
                    wn but indicates UOM ?L? and this is the value that the quantity is multiplied by this to create 
                    cost.
                    
                    Cost should be the LOT price no matter what quantity is received.
                    
                    If we then click update and correct value in price column amount is correctly reflected?

                     coming from.  If you look at their VR9 Report by customer and add up all the taxable invoices fo
                    r TN they equal $12,290.16, but the VR6 does not show that.
                    
                    Also, the Gross Sales Amount should include CR/DB memos from Accounts Receivable.

                    However, the program should not allow selecting another location.
                    Only the Default Location can be selected.
                    Please note, if we allow a user to select a lcoation that is not the default, 
                    many other bugs then appear in estimating and other modules.
                    The solution.
                    Allow only the user to select a Company.  
                    The Default Location will be the only location available to select.

                    We must display all locations.
                    ONLY Default should be selected.
                    If there are no Default Locations, Program will automatically set MAIN as default.
                    This should never happen.
                    With new Login logic, if Users COMPANY tab does not have a DEFAULT LOCATION, 
                    they will be locked out of Menu and cannot reset the USER ID file.
                    If the cannot get to menu, then cannot change the default.
                    LOGIN must automatically select default Location.
