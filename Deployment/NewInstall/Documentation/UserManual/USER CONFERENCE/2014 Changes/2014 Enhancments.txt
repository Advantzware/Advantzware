                    Quote form will be for *1ST ITEM ONLY*.  Because of the format, there can be only one Item on the

                    1)  I-F-1 must be use new Active / Inactive DB Field.
                         Utility needed to Convert Ref Table to DB Field.
                    2)  O-U-1 Items Tab - Add order to use new Active / Inactive DB Field.
                    2)  E-Q-1 Add Quote to use new FG Active / Inactive

                    story tab of IF1.
                    This mod will add the Unit Weight column to the list of editable columns.
                    On the Bins browser, also when logged in as ASI, this mod will allow for editing of the the Unit 
                    Weight column to the list of editable columns in the Bins/Jobs Tab of IF1.

                    New toggle Box.  Show Bins if Qty = 0.  This will default to Not Display.
                    All customers should run N-F-10 and Recalc Button and NOT Delete Zero Qty Bins.
                    However, the new Toggle Box will default to UnChecked.
                    This will HIDE the Bins with ZERO on Hand.
                    Except, OPEN Jobs.  They will still Display.
                    Reason for new Toggle Box.
                    The calculated Bins table is needed to put the proper cost on reports.
                    This table is also needed to transfer costs to a posted invoice.
                    For example, 
                    A csutomer receives and shipped a product such as ATT-2297 for Job 205938
                    The Tags are received and shipped and show zero on Hand.
                    If the Recalc Qtyt is run and the DELETE zero Qty Bins is Run. the Tags are Removed.
                    When Customers runs  I-R-2 for a date after the Receeipt but Before the Shipment.
                    The Bin/Tags would appear o the Report.
                    The Problem is the Cost cannot be found in the Bins Table.
                    Then the Program imports the Average Cost form the VIEW Table which is Wrong.
                    Keeping the Bins Table Open will Ensure the Cost is Correct on IR2 and other Programs.

                    1)  I-F-1 ReCalc Cost Button Works Great.
                          The button Imports Cost from HISTORY to rebuild Bins Tab then the View Item Tab.
                           However, this only fixes ONE FG item at a time.
                           The * Option allows fixing the Entire Inventory.
                    This needs improvement
                    a)      Replace * Option with the Following
                    b)     Add toggle Box called ___ Include Inactive Items.    Similar logic to N-F-10.

                    This can be by added by Unique Customer Part# or the Generic Part#.
                    Adding Quotes for Finished Goods will import the Sales Rep from Totals/CP# Table if Defined.
                    Adding Estimate with a Finished Goods Item will import the Rep frrom Totals/CP# Table.

                    Please 
                    When invoices are created, the sales rep transferred from the order to the invoice.
                    All commissions and sales reports print based on the sales rep on the invoice.
                    However, currently Finished Goods reports print the sales rep from the customer file.
                    The following finished goods reports must be changed to print from the I-F-1 file if a sales rep 
                    exists.  If the rep is blank in the I-F-1 Totals Tab, then print from Customer File.

                    ALSO Task 12091410 has logic to add a SALES REP field to the Total/CP# field.
                    Once added, this task can be completed.
                    It is possible to have a different sales rep for each customer on the Totals/CP# Field.
                    But, there will be only one Rep on the Totals/ CP#  tab that matches the Customer with Status X. 
                    For example, FG item 8x8x8 has a customer = STOCK, who has a status = X.
                    That is the Sales Rep that will be used on the FG Report.
                    A) If the existing report pulls the sales rep from the order, then no programming is needed.
                    B) If the existing report pulls the sales rep from the Customer File, this must be changed.
                         1)  If the Sales Rep Feild is blank, then the existing logic will be used.
                         2)  If the Totals/CP# has a Sales Rep defined, this REP will print on the Report.
                    Please Note.

                    umns similar to the Release Qty and Rel Date fields that already exist.  The same Release lines f
                    rom OU1 Release tab should be used for these columns.  The Release break out is available when on
                    ly the "Detail" option is checked.  When "Summary is checked" these columns should show data the 
                    same way the Rel Date and Rel Qty columns (not sure if it just shows one release or blanks but it
                     should be consistent).
                    
                    The columns to add are:
                    1. Release PO# - This PO should be the Customer PO from the release line that corresponds to the 
                    release qty and release date that is currently available.
                    2. Release Lot# - This should be the Customer Lot#  from the release line that corresponds to the
                     release qty and release date that is currently available.
                    3. Prod. Qty for Lot - This needs to use the "Customer Lot# (column 2 above) to identify receipts
                     in IF1 History tab that have that Lot# as the FG Lot#.  Note: this column may be slow to calcula
                    te.  Only calculate the data for this, if the column is selected for inclusion.  
                    
                    ASI testing: See ASI Order 207823.  There are 2 releases.  One release has a Customer Lot # of 12
                    3.  This should correspond to a receipt for ATT-2297 of 20,000.  This would be the value that sho
                    uld be shown for #3 for this release.  The other release line has no Lot# and would thus show 0.

                    Add a toggle called "Signed" to the BOL Header viewer.
                    
                    This should be controlled by the value of spare-int-1.
                    
                    Override this should act as follows:
                    If user checks this manually, check to see that a signature image exists locally.  If it doesn't,
                     check the web service for that specific BOL.  If it does not exist in either location, present a
                     warning message that says "Signature image does not exist.  Do you want to mark BOL as signed an
                    yway?" (yes/no). 
                    
                    If user uncheks this manually, check to see if an image exists locally or on the web-service.
                    If it does, ask the user if they want to delete the image:
                    "A signature has been captured for this BOL.  Do you want to delete it?" (yes/no)
                    Hitting yes will remove the local image file.

                    2) PO Due Date - Earliest Due Date of any open POs for the item.  
                        This would be the Due Date on the Items Detail in PU1.
                    
                    3) Job Due Date - Similarly, for manufactured items, this should be the earliest Job Due Date for

                    When unchecked, this should bypass 50% of the FG Items in the Premier DB.
                    This should speed up this report.
                    
                    The I-F-1 Active/Inactive Field should be at the begining of the search for FG items.

I-R-1-   12171402 E N-K REPORTS View Form IR1 Logical = Yes -  Sales Rep by FG Item
                    Task 12091410 has logic to add a SALES REP field to the Total/CP# field.
                    Once added, this task can be completed.
                    It is possible to have a different sales rep for each customer on the Totals/CP# Field.
                    But, there will be only one Rep on the Totals/ CP#  tab that matches the Customer with Status X. 
                    For example, FG item 8x8x8 has a customer = STOCK, who has a status = X.
                    That is the Sales Rep that will be used on the FG Report.
                    
                    A) If the existing report pulls the sales rep from the order, then no programming is needed.
                    B) If the existing report pulls the sales rep from the Customer File, this must be changed.
                         1)  If the Sales Rep Feild is blank, then the existing logic will be used.
                         2)  If the Totals/CP# has a Sales Rep defined, this REP will print on the Report.
                    
                    
                    Please Note.
                    It is OK to add logic to both Legacy Report and New Report Writer Format

I-U-1-   02111402 E N-K FGSetAssembly  Logic for Assembled Set Components
                    N-K-1 FGSetAssembly =  New Assembled Set Receipt Logic.  Menu Keys I-F-1 Finished Goods File:  To
                    ggle Box Set Header?  and Assembled?  are both Checked.
                    Reason for the Business Logic.  Components are produced at Plant A then Transferred to Plant B fo
                    r assembly.  Pallet Tags are stored in various bin locations in Plant B.   Pallet Tags must be tr
                    ansferred to the Plant Floor Bin called Assembly.   Only the tags transferred to Assembly should 
                    be subtracted from On hand when the Set Receipts are Received On Hand.
                    
                    Character Value = ASSEMBLY  is the Bin Location of all Set Components that are consummed and Disp
                    layed on the FG Receipts SET PARTS Tab.  For each Warehouse that assembles SETS and use the N-K-1
                     FGSetAssembly logoc must have a bin location called ASSEMBLY.   This will be the bin location th
                    at set components are consummed when receiving Sets.
                    
                    Logical Value = No will use existing Logic that pulls random inventory.
                    Logical Value = YES will turn on this new logic for Adding receipts for assembled sets.
                    Both O-U-7 Loadtag creation and  I-U-1 Set Receipts will Recieve the Set to the warehouse and bin
                     location based on existing logic.   However, the Components Warehouse will default to the Sets W
                    arehouse.   But, the components Bin Location will first search on hand Pallet Tags from the Bin L
                    ocation called ASSEMBLY.   If there is insufficent component inventory in the Assembly Bin Locati
                    on, the program will import existing bin Locations.     However, I-U-5 Inventory Posting will not
                     post set receipts or components unless all components have the Assembly Bin locations.  The I-U-
                    5 Posting report will show the message,  "Component Assembly Bin Location is Required"  and they 
                    will not Post until Componetns Bin = Assembly.

                    Another task removes references to the reftable.
I-U-1-   05131401 E Set Parts Tab  - Receiving Screens - Add Select Bins/Tags Button
                    Selecting the appropriate bins/tags from which to relieve component inventory when receiving a se
                    t header is a time consuming process.   This modification will create a "Select Bins/Tags" button
                    , similar to the function that is available in OS1 and OT1.
                    Component bins will be automatically selected when a set header is received in I-U-1.  The N-K-1 
                    FGSETASSEMBLY logic will pull from bin locations specified in the character value of this NK1 whi
                    ch may be used to pull component from a staging area location called ASSEMBLY.  This mod would be
                     in addition to the automatic bin selection process and will allow the user to change component b
                    in/tag locations quickly and easily.
                    When the user selects one of the lines in the Set Parts tab and hits the Select Bin/Tags button, 
                    a multi-select browse window will pop-up, listing all on-hand bins for the selected component ite
                    m.  The window should have a running tally of the total qty selected next to the total qty needed
                    .  All validation that exists in the OS1 "Select Bin/Tags" button should apply to this new button
                    .
                    Note:  This button should only apply to Assembled Sets.  Furthermore, for Assembled with Parts re
                    ceipts, only purchased components should allow this selection, since manufactured items have a "w
                    ash" transaction of receipt and reduction in inventory.

                    The result will be that previously selected tags will be removed from the components tab if the u

                    N-K-1 FGSetAssembly Logical = YES.
                    This mod will change the logic used to select component bins when receiving an assembled set head
                    er in I-U-1, SharpShooter, and OU7 (when Set Header receipts are automatically created - NOTE: Pr
                    emier does not activate this option).
                    When FGSetAssembly is YES, *ONLY* components that are in the specified assembly bin (FGSetAssembl
                    y char value) and in a warehouse that matches the warehouse of the set header receipt should be c
                    onsidered on-hand for the purposes of relieving component inventory.  No other bin locations shou
                    ld ever appear on the Set Parts tab in IU1 or SS.
                    Additionally, upon receiving and saving a set header today, a pop-up will launch, warning the use
                    r that there is insufficient component inventory.
                    This exists today, however a new improved pop-up will display each component showing:
                    Component ID, Component Name, Qty/Set, Required Qty, Qty On-hand
                    Components with insufficient inventory will be highlighted in yellow.
                    When FGSetAssembly is YES, there will be NO option to create a set header receipt for a qty less 
                    than what is being originally received.  Hitting OK on the message will simply NOT save the recei
                    pt line and return the user back to the receipt application, ready to add (IU1) or scan (SS) the

                    This new field can be updated by the User ID ASI or users with security via the Program Master.

                    y updates the RM History table.
                    Business Reason for this Logic.
                    When RM Receipts are posted, the A/P Invoice# and/or Status is updated in the RM History database
                    .   This logic is used when adding an A/P invoice from a purchase order.
                    Somehow,  purchase orders with multiple lines are showing the wrong status.
                    For example, 1 PO Line is received and Invoice.
                    However, the 2 PO Line item is received but the user cannot add the A/P Invoice.
                    The warning on the V-U-1 Invoice line tab states "No PO Avaialbe"

                    For example, if I buy Bubble 1.25"  and receive this the Main warehouse and Floor Bin location.
                    If I have 4 purchase orders during the year for this item, the last Vendor PO# will be the only V
                    endor PO# displayed in the Bin file.

                    Util/FindReplaceFilePath.r - New Utility to Update the Disk Drive Letter
                    The customer stores attachments on the PAPER CLIP Icon throughout the system.
                    They have a new server and new disk drive letter.
                    They need the beginnning character replaced, which is the disk drive changed.
                    
                    This utility will allow the user to find and replace the old drive letter (or any folder) with a 
                    new drive letter.    There will be a "Find File Path:" and a "Replace File Path with:"
                    To change the drives across all attachments, user would simply enter "P:\" in the Find field and 
                    "Q:\" in the Replace field.
                    
                    Additionally, there should be a check box that says "Include Box Designs" that will include these
                     special database tables in the find/replace search.
                    
                    Please Note:
                    This utility does not search on the beginning characters.
                    This will find and replace any string of characters that match.
                    So if you Replace N with Z.  This will replace all letters including folders and file names.
                    If you want to replace the N Drive they must type N:   with Z:

O-B-4-   05291402 E cXML Processing  - Order Entry, ASN, & Invoicing
                    NOTE: This mod includes the previously quoted mod for the Invoice piece only (#12131306).
                    This mod will enable receipt of orders through cXML and transmission of cXML Advance Ship Notices
                     (ASN) and cXML Invoices.  Specs on required cXML formats are attached.
                    ASN & Invoice:
                    cXML Invoice generation is triggered by Premier user.  A new interface will be created that allow
                    s specifying a date range of invoices for a given customer. 
                    ASN piece would also be triggered by Premier user when the user prints a BOL (first time only, no
                    t reprint).  This would only execute special cXML handling if the customer is activated in an NK1
                     (cXMLASN. - View Form per customer)
                     - In both cases, this would generate a cXML file with a file name that indicates customer, data 
                    type and run date. 
                     - The cXML data that would then be pushed/transmitted to customer based on instructions stored i
                    n an NK1 for each customer. (cXMLASN & cXMLInvoice)
                     - There would be a log kept of transmissions.
                    Order Import piece:
                     - Assumption:  This is for stock item orders only.  No jobs will be automatically created.
                     - Receipt of the cXML would be a push from customer (Ariba) to an ASI/Premier web-service.  This
                     push would trigger the import process without any user interaction. 
                     - Similar to OEImport, orders come in to the system into O-W for approval.  
                     - The information in the cXML for the order should override any pricing in the system.  This wou
                    ld only apply to the individual order and should not affect the price matrix.
                     - ShipTo information needs to be added dynamically if the shipto ID provided is not already a va
                    lid ASI shipto.  If the shipto ID already exists in ASI, the new address information should be up
                    dated.
                     - Scheduled release would be created with the appropriate shipto ID.
                     - Change & cancellation orders would not affect ASI directly.  These will be handled by generati
                    ng an email detailing the change/cancellation.
O-B-4-   10061401 E cXML Processing  - Lookup Shipto tax code based on state
                    When ShipTos are automatically created, they are importing the tax code from the default shipTo (
                    this is the Shipto with the same ID as the Customer Number - DSG for instance).
                    This mod will add an additional lookup to the tax code table to attempt to find a match of the Sh
                    ipto State.
                    If a Tax Group is found that matches the State code, that will be used as the Tax Code on the new
                     shipTo.  Otherwise, the Tax Code will use the default as it does today (Note:  if Premier wants 
                    this to fall back to INT, that is what should be used on the default ShipTo).
                    
                    Change to above:
                    Instead of using the STATE Abbreviation as the tax code, the system will look for an existing shi
                    pto from the same state and use the tax code specified on that shipto.
O-B-4-   10211409 E cXML Processing  - cXMLASN Integer Val = 1 - generate on reprint only
                    If integer value of cXMLASN is 1, generate the ASN cXML.  Integer value 0 will still process on f
                    irst print only.
                    NOTE: The integer value must be set at the VIEW FORM level (customer specific) in the NK1.O-F-8-   11111402 E cXML Order Processing - ShipTo requires handling of DICKS: prefix
                    New N-K-1 cXMLShipToParse - Character value
                    This only applies at the View Form/Customer specific level.
                    The Character Value per customer will identify any prefix that needs to be trimmed before auto cr
                    eating the shipTo on order import.  Additionally, this prefix will need to be re-applied to the S
                    hipTo when creating the cXML files to be transmitted back to Ariba.
                    For example, if Shipto is "DICKS:00001", the system will parse the DICKS: prefix and load the shi
                    pto in the ASI system as 00001.  Additionally, when building the cXML for ASN, Invoices and Ackno
                    wledgements, the ShipTo ID must be added to the "Contact" segment with the Prefix added.
                    Example:
                    <Contact addressID="DICKS:00001" role="shipto">

O-R-13  07071407 E OR13 BackLog report - Toggle Boxes = Shipped Value ___   Invoiced Valu
                    See attached documents two pages.
                    When an order is INVOICE only, the OR13 does not reduce the backlog value because nothing has shi
                    pped.  That logic is pefect and will not be changed.
                    Currently, the O-R-13 backlog report calculates the backlog based on Quantity Orders less Qty Shi
                    pped.  However, Invoice Only Releases are not considered as zero quantity has shipped.
                    1)  The Solution is a new New Toggle box called 
                          Sales Value?  Shipped Value    ____     This is the Current Logic is Value by Order Qty.
                                                       Invoiced Value  ______.
                    New logic when checking Invoice Qty will substract the Invoiced Qty times Sell Price (Invoiced Sa
                    les)  from the Order Value Sales (Order Qty x Selling Price).
                    2)  The HM1 Report, the Excel Speadsheet called Sales F/C uses the OR13 report.
                          This should be changed to use the new O-R-13 Toggle Box option called Invoice Qty
                    TESTING

                         b)  Sales Value incorrect per attached.  Qty Due/1000 x Sales price = Backlog Value
                               For new Invoice Value 
                              Order 207650 = 25,000 Ordered  less 25,000 Invoice Only = ZERO DOLLARS
                              Order 207653 = 24,000 less 15,000 invoiced x $193.49/M  = $1741.41

                    Task 07071407 added in Toggle Box to Show Invoiced Value.
                    The calculate is to take the Order Qty Value less the Invoiced Value for Backlog Value.
                    Invoice Only releases will lower this value.
                    HM1 uses the OR13 report and this new logic should be used in HM1.
                    
                    Problem is that I do not know how to Test.
                    The HM1 Report, the Excel Speadsheet called Sales F/C uses the OR13 report.
                    This should be changed to use the new O-R-13 Toggle Box option called Invoice Qty

                    Important:  A ShipTo is not defined until a Scheduled Release is created.  This happens automatic
                    ally when you add an order item, but not until that order item is saved.  Also, it is possible to
                     have multiple Scheduled Releases going to different ship to locations.  This mod will use the *F
                    irst* Scheduled Release to determine the ship to location to use for the values of M,N,P,C and D 
                    .

                    Add Wild Card Search with *..........*   to search items for any text that would be contained in 
                    the name (not just the beginning of the name).  
                    For example, if I type *Bubble*  all the bubble wrap will display.
                    
                    1) Add wild Card Search to Item#
                    2) Add wild Card Search to Item Name
                    3) Add wild Card Search to Cust Part#.
                    
                    
                    Add the wild card to O-U-1 Order Browser which only shows open Orders
                    Add the wild card to O-Q-1 Order Query
                    Add the wild card to O-U-6 Closed Orders 
                    
                    
                    PLEASE NOTE.
                    We still need to be able to search by mulitple fields.
                    For example Customer = Miller   and  Item# = *Miller*

                    For Example.
                    Add Customer Code on VIEW FormTab.
                    For each Customer = TACOBELL.
                    View Form Character Value = ShipFromWhse&SamePO#SamePO#.
                    See ASI order 207704
                    Items 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6 and 7x7x7 will ship from MAIN
                    Item Bubble .25"  will ship from NJ.
                    All items have the same Customer PO#.
                    Form Items Tab.  Click RELEASE button.
                    This would create two unique Release Numbers.
                    The box Items will be on the 1st  Release Number.
                    The bubble wrap will be on 2nd Release Number.

                    Print only FG item = FAT TIRE.
                    The order number 207580 prints twice on the Excel Output. 
                    The reason is because we added the Release Qty as a selectable field.
                    
                    1) Add new Toggle Box.
                         Print Detail by Release Date?
                         Yes will print as this currently prints.
                    
                         Print Detail by Release Date?  = NO.
                         Then this will only print one line per FG item per Order.  
                         This will only print the 1st Release. 
                         This was the Logic before making the programming change for Release Date.

                    The prompt "Invoice Format:" appeared in the TEST environments of Premier and Protagon recently. 
                     This is done by the programs listed below.
                    
                    It looks pretty straightforward, leading me to believe that the query failed and the INVPRINT rec
                    ord was not there.  This is troubling.
                    The first part of the task would be in identifying how the sys-ctrl query could fail, other than 
                    the INVPRINT record not existing.  Bad "cocode"?
                    The second part of the task would be in identifying how to validate that no sys-ctrl records are 
                    deleted automatically by any code (load procedures, etc).

                    New email  notification when creating a BOL through Sharp Shooter.  
                    1)  A warning message already exists to warn the user that the scanned qty is less than the      
                    released qty.  The first change is to enhance this message to warn if the qty is different.      
                    (over or under the original OT1 qty).
                    2) An email notification process already exists if a BOL is created when:
                         a) an FG Item is added to an existing release
                         b) an FG Item is removed from an existing release
                         c) an order is added to an existing release
                    This mod will add a 4th reason to generate an email:
                        d) Creating a BOL with a total scanned qty for a given item that is greater than
                             or less than the qty originally on the OT1 release. 
                    
                    If the user continues to process the BOL after receiving the warning message,
                     then an email will be sent using the same process that already exists for the emails generated f
                    or criteria a, b or c above.
