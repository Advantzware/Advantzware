A-F-1-   01301506 E Change Book Icon to Fountain Pen
                    See attached.
                    This is an Icon Change Only.
                    The Book Icon holds department notes, group notes and customer notes.
                    The Fountain Pen in Estimating and Order Processing holds the Department Notes.
                    
                    Therefore, it would be more friendly for the this icon to be a Fountain Pen.
                    It will be the exact same functionality that it now has.
                    We are only changing the appearance of the Icon.
                    
                    
                    The book icon in estimating and order entry are for Finished goods Spec Notes.
                    Threfore, the A-F-1 showing a Book is confusing to new customers and new plant employees.
                    The Icons should be similar throughtout.
                    
                    When Notes Exist, the Fountain Pen Background must turn YELLOW.
                    John Loeb of ASI can make new Icon if that is needed.

                    The cost calculation is perfect on both forms.

                    Form 1 needs 6,500,000 x 1 per Set / 48 Up = 135417
                    A positive set quantity is multiplied by the Set Quantity.
                    MSF for Form 1 = 135,417 times the Gross Sheets Square Footage.
                    The Total MSF is perfect on Page 1 of the Estimate, which uses 135,417 sheets.
                    
                    Form 2 has -7200 per set which means divided by 7200.
                    The minus sign is a division sign.
                    Form 2 is a packing case used for the Pads on form 1.
                    There are 7200 pads put into each packing case.
                    Form 2 needs 6,500,000 /7200 per Set / 1 Up = 903 Sheets.
                    The Total MSF is perfect on Page 2 of the Estimate, which uses 903 sheets.

                    Once added, this task can be completed.
                    It is possible to have a different sales rep for each customer on the Totals/CP# Field.
                    But, there will be only one Rep on the Totals/ CP#  tab that matches the Customer with Status X. 
                    For example, FG item 8x8x8 has a customer = STOCK, who has a status = X.
                    That is the Sales Rep that will be used on the FG Report.
                    
                    A) If the existing report pulls the sales rep from the order, then no programming is needed.
                    B) If the existing report pulls the sales rep from the Customer File, this must be changed.
                         1)  If the Sales Rep Feild is blank, then the existing logic will be used.
                         2)  If the Totals/CP# has a Sales Rep defined, this REP will print on the Report.

                    New Selectable Fields.
                    1) Add new Field called "5 Mo Avg"
                    This will be a straight average of the last 5 months of history, not including the most recent mo
                    nth.  So if the 6 month history prints:

                    The 5 MO Avg would be (100 + 1200 + 1100 + 1000 + 900)/5.  Note the exclusion of the 200 for the

                    But, there will be only one Rep on the Totals/ CP#  tab that matches the Customer with Status X. 
                    For example, FG item 8x8x8 has a customer = STOCK, who has a status = X.
                    That is the Sales Rep that will be used on the FG Report.

                    Adding Transfer should import the current Warehouse/Bin, Units and Counts to the FROM.
                    The TO Location will Copy the FROM Warehouseto the TO Warehouse.
                    However the Cursor will pause on the Warehouse Field.

                    This posts GL transactions based on the FG Category.
                    
                    All FG transactions require customer enter a posting date.
                    For example, If I enter transaction date on I-U-1 of 12/30/14 and I enter post date of 12/30/14 t
                    his should post to 12/30-14.   The Post report still posts to the Current Date.
                    This must post to the POST DATE Entered.
                    
                    As another example,
                    Find Order 207576
                    Click Items Tab and Click LoadTag Icon.
                    Create 1 Tag for 2500 per Unit.
                    This will create Receipt in I-U-1.
                    Next Click I-U-5 and change Posting Date to Saturdays date of 4-19-14.
                    Post Receipt.
                    The History will always be the Date Entered on the I-U-1 Screen.
                    However, the Post Date should be the I-U-5 Posting Date of 4-19-14.
                    Likewise, If I Recieve 10,000 which will close Job, the Close Job should Also be on the Posting D
                    ate.
                    
                    Please note,  I dont know if we save the POSTING date ?
                    History must be the Date Entered which it does correctly post to History.
                    I assume I-L-6 is by Posting Date but this may be by Transaction Date ???
                    
I-U-5-   12301405 B N-K FGINVREC    Ship Only Invoice should have Zero Sell Price
                    O-U-1 Release is SHIP ONLY.
                    N-K-1 FGINVREC date is YES
                    Character Value = ALLITEMS will create a single invoice for all items.
                    Customer Orders for FG items that are FARM OUTS / Purchased.
                    PO to the Vendor is a DROP SHIPMENT type.
                    When posting FG receipts will create O-B-1 Invoice for the PO Receipt.
                    
                    When Adding FG Receipt for Drop Shipment PO.
                    The invoice created should have ZERO Sell Price when Release is SHIP ONLY.
                    
                    To Test.
                    See ASI Order 208245.  
                    The release type on the Release tab is a SHIP ONLY.
                    The Vendor PO# on the items Tab is102798
                    The P-U-1 PO# 102798 is a Drop Shipment
                    When I receive the PO, i answer YES to create the invoice.
                    This invoice should show a ZERO quantity for the Invoice Qty.
                    
                    If release was a B for Bill and Ship, the logic is perfect.
J-L-6-   01211501 B N-K REPORTS JL6 -  Total Price (SP Actual) doesn't convert from CS uom
                    The SP Actual column on the JL6 report does not handle a FG with a Sell UOM of CS.
                    This only applies to stock jobs for items with a sell UOM of CS.  Instead of dividing the FG sell
                     price by the case count and then multiplying it by the job qty, the program just multiplies the 
                    job qty (EA) by the case sell price.
                    
                    Run JL6 for Job W11625-00.  The SP Actual comes out to 150,000.  This is because the Unit Price i
                    n IF1 is $2 per case.  Job Qty of 3000 * 50 = $150,000.
                    This should reduce the price by the case count of 100 and the SP should be $1500.

                    See ATTACHED . 
                    J-R3 shows wrong estimated sheets when Forms have no Board Material Issued.
                    This occurs when all material is issued to FORM 1 on a Tandem or Combo Job.  
                    When form show zero sheets issued, the system is calculating estimated sheets based quantity rece
                    ived + waste divided by Number Up.  
                    The program is being changed to calculate by Form on Task 07081309.  
                    HOWEVER
                    This logic  will never be perfect when multiple rolls are used and posted to FORM 1 rather than p

                    2)  Allocating an inventoried board to the item. 
                    Either change always seems to reset the job info at the top of the screen. 
                    If we go back and type in the job number, everything is good
                    
                    We have to go back and type in the job number of the one we are actually working on
                    (even though it shows on the screen that it is the active file), to get the print to pull up the 
                    correct job ticket, or we have to be mindful to change the job ticket number in the print screen.
                    
                    
                    To Duplicate:
                    Changed N-K-1 JobCreat to S
                    Go to J-U-1 create job for estimate 11956
                    Go to materials folder and update the board to something else and click save.
                    The Job at the top of the screen changes to the job of the first job of the browse folder.
M-C-2-   02041506 B Validate Warehouse and Bin
                    You fixed this in Sharp Shooter but M-C-2 has the same Problem.
                    Add Cycle Count for Item SBS18-24
                    Paste Tag# 01022990010000011
                    
                    Then Paste the same Tag Number 01022990010000011 in the Warehouse field.
                    This creates a new Line with an Invalid Warehouse and/or Bin.
                    
                    I get error messages but click OK allows user to continue.
                    That should not happen.
                    
                    Then CANCEL Saves the Record.
                    That is really bad.
M-F-1-   01301507 B Excel Export missing "Warehouse" field
                    Add "Warehouse" and "Bin" to the available fields for exporting from MF1.  They should've been in
                     the list originally.
M-R-3-   12291401 B Receipt Date appears to be Date of Transfer
                    Find RM Item = GLUE 
                    When Inventory has a Tag#, there is only 1 receipt date.
                    I transferred tag# 01027730010000010 and now the Receipt Date shows 10/10/14.
                    This should continue to show 12/12/14
                    Tags with Transfer Date is Showing on the Report.   This should be the Receipt Date.
                    
                    See Attached.
                    This shows the TRANSFER DATE.  THis must show the Receipt Date.
                    
                    Receitp for Tag 01027730010000010 was in 2014.
                    I transferred on Jan 29, 2015 
                    Now Receipt date on report shows 1/29/15
                    Which is wrong.
                    
                    There is only 1 receipt date for a Tag#.
M-R-5-   01061504 B N-K Reports = MR5  - Extend Description field
                    N-K-1 Reports.
                    New View Form = MR5
                    
                    Description field only prints first 15 characters.  It should print all 30 characters allowed in 
                    the name field of MF1.
                    
                    Run MR5 for Item: 26#L-30" (select material type P) to test.
M-U-2-   01161505 E ADD Job# and Fix Spelling of Radio Buttons
                    See Attached.
                    Fix the spelling per attached.
                    Also Add Job# as a Search Option.
M-U-3-   02041501 B RM Transfers UPDATE button should not allow Qty Changes
                    Add Transfer for Item SBS18-24
                    Click the History Tab and Type PO# 102423 to see all the Tags for this PO#.
                    Next, Click Sharp Shooter
                    Click RM Transfer
                    Add Transfer for Tag# 01024230010000011
                    This should import 20,000 when entering the Tag#.
                    
                    The UPDATE button allows me to change the Quantity which is a partial Transfer.
                    This keeps the same tag# in both locations which is IMPOSSIBLE.
                    The Quantity field cannot be updated in Add mode or Update Mode.
                    Prevent any update to the Quantity Field when using Tag#.
                    If the Tag# is Blank, then the Quantity Field can be Changed.
                    
                    
                    
                    Please note,
                    Another task can be written to allow creating a new Tag# for the TO Warehouse and Bin.
                    That would be a billable task.
                    The Work-a-Round for Partial Transfers.
                    Create Two CYCLE Counts for the original Tag# and new Tag#.

                    Order# 208230
                    Invoice# 7597
                    
                    The Sold To on the View order is Matt23 which is 121 Seville Drive
                    This order is only for a Misc Charge.
                    The Invoice displays 123 Seville Drive which is the address of Matt21 which is wrong.
                    This needs to bring in the Sold To on the View Order Folder.
O-B-1-   02051508 B Adding an invoice manually does not update the price UOM from the scre
                    Add an item with a price defined in OF3 price matrix to OB1.
                    
                    Price comes in correctly but the UOM does not.
O-B-3-   01281507 B N-K InvPrint=Xprint  Not showing all tax codes
                    Invoice print is only showing 2 tax codes in totals.  If there are 3 or more in the tax group the
                     others do not print.  The grand total however is correct and adds all taxes into it.

O-B-3-   01291506 B N-K InvPrint=Xprint   - Bill Notes don't print when customer is Group
                    Invoice 7602 in OB1 doesn not print the notes on the Bill Notes tab.  
                    This invoice is for customer 5Below
                    A-F-1  Invoice Method =  "Group By Date".
                    When customer is set to Group by Date, the Bill Notes are not printing.
                    
                    
                    Contrast this with 7601 which does print the note on the BIll Notes tab.  
                    Hershey A-F-1 IInvoice Type is set to Invoice per BOL.

                    7610 - Ship To 1123
                    7611 - Ship To 1123
                    
                    Set up OB3:
                    Customer:  ZOV100 to ZOV100
                    Invoice 7610 to 7611

                    Output to Email with  Batch Email option checked.
                    This results in one email with a PDF that includes both invoices 7610 and 7611.  This is correct.
                    
                    
                    Next setup:

                    Bols: 0 to 99999999
                    Output to Email with  Batch Email option checked.
                    This results in one email with a PDF that only shows invoice 7609.  This is a bug

                    If user press SAVE button and Cost = ZERO, the program will prompt.
                    "Sorry Feight Cost cannot be Zero, Please press OK to Update"
                    This would immediately return the cursor to the Freight Cost Field.

                    This prints the Customer Lot # in the PO location on the BOL.  When they have one ShipTo set up w

                    The I-L-6 Report and I-F-1 History should show the different dates.
O-T-1-   06061401 E Automated import of Actual OT1 Releases
                    1) The objective from an ASI perspective is to automate the creation of an "Actual" release (OT1)
                     in the Foldware system with release lines populated with pallet tag/bin information.  
                    a. The "Scheduled" release in OU1 must also be created and linked to the corresponding Actual rel
                    ease.  
                    b. The Scheduled release will be either a "B" (bill and ship) or "S" based on specifications in t
                    he data file/user choice outside of ASI.  
                    c. An order must already exist in Foldware.  No orders will be dynamically created.
                    d. Hybrid Software will be providing a data file that will include: 
                    Order Number, Ship-to Code, Release Qty, Ship Date, Customer PO#, FG item numbers, Pallet Tags an
                    d Quantity Per Tag. (Ship-only or Bill & Ship) Please note, shipping a partial pallet tag is poss
                    ible so we need to know tag qty shipped. 
                    e. Each data file will always create a new actual release.  N-K Relmerge logic will NOT apply to 
                    this process.  The data file could consist of multiple orders, items, inventory locations.  All o
                    f these will be tied to a single actual release.  Additional lines will not be added to an existi
                    ng actual release.  Obviously, the data file must have the same Customer, Ship To location, and R
                    elease Date.
                    2) ASI must load the data supplied by Hybrid into the system with no user interaction.  This proc
                    ess will be modeled after the RFID process that already exists at Accord today.
                    3) Existing system limitations will apply, outside of stated changes above

                    1)  Add toggle box on O-T-3 Print section to Print Spec Notes.
                         With Box on which Spec Notes to Print 
                    
                    2)  Print the Spec Notes on the Release Ticket Accross the Entire Page under the FG Item.
                          There can be many FG items on a Release so the Spec note will print by FG Item.
                    
                    3)  Spec Notes are type in the BOOK ICON in the Finished Goods Item File
                          Its the same Icon in the Estimate, Order, FG Item and Job File.
                          Only the Spec Note Code on the O-T-3 Print Screen will print.
                    
                    
                    For Example, the attached item has notes for the spec code = IT
                    This stands for Item Notes.
                    The O-T-3 will have the Note IN written next to the toggle Box.
                    
                    Please note, more that 1 Spec Note may be defined.

                    CANCEL button SHOULD NOT Erase the Prices that were imported.
                    
                    When adding orders without an estimate number, 
                    the current logic imports sales price from either the O-F-3 price matrix .
                    If a Price Matrix exists for the Customer, the Quoted Prices should be Bypassed.
                    The Logic to display the Quoted Prices erases the Imported Price from the Matrix.
                    If a quote exists for the Item,
                    Prompt,  Display Quoted Prices for this Item.?
                    Yes will display the Quoted Prices?   However, Exit or Cancel will Escape and Keep Price.
                    No will Bypass this Logic.
                    
                    For example, add order for Customer ATT1000 for item 8x8x8 and leave estimate# blank.
                    This imports the price from the O-F-3 Matrix.
                    However, it then displays the Quoted Prices.
                    
                    CANCEL button SHOULD NOT Erase the Prices that were imported.
                    If I cancel or Exit, 
                    The Imported Price from the Matix is Erased.

                    Add date change reason tracking for Promise Date (A2) on the Order Item Detail screen.  This will
                     be similar to that of the tracking for release date changes, which captures information regardin
                    g date change reasons, user id, etc.
                    1. This will be activated by setting N-K OEDATECHANGE integer value = 1 (developer note: see solu
                    tion for options) and will only apply if the date is being changed from an existing valid date (i
                    .e. not initially blank).
                    2. When a change is detected, a pop-up screen will be displayed, requiring the user to select a r
                    eason code and supply a note.  
                    3. The reason codes can be added and editted through OF9.

                       a. The Order Item Due Date (A1) will be set initially by the CSR
                       b. When the Order Item Due Date (A1) is edited, the Promise Date (A2)  should be calculated by
                     subtracting the "In Transit" days from A1 (A2 = A1 - M).  Subsequently, the Order Header Due Dat
                    e (B) should be changed such that B = A2.
                       b.  When the Promise Date (A2) is changed, the Order Item Due Date (A1) should be calculated b
                    y adding the "In Transit" days to A2 (A1 = A2 + M).  Subsequently, the Order Header Due Date (B) 
                    should be changed such that B = A1.
                    
                    Important:  A ShipTo is not defined until a Scheduled Release is created.  This happens automatic
                    ally when you add an order item, but not until that order item is saved.  Also, it is possible to
                     have multiple Scheduled Releases going to different ship to locations.  This mod will use the *F
                    irst* Scheduled Release to determine the ship to location to use for the value of M . If a Schedu
                    led release is not found (initial order entry for instance) the M will be queried from the ShipTo
                     that matches the Customer Code.

                    New Field called Count will be added to the Items Tab.
                    QUANTITY PER CS
                          This will be display only and will display the Case Count from the I-F-1 View Tab.
                           When Order Qty UOM = CS, 
                    The Quantity on the line will be multiplied by the Count Field to calculate the PO On Order Qty.
                    For example.
                             ASI item 4x4x4 has a case count of 25.
                             If I place PO for 10 CS, this should display as 250 on Order.
                    The ON ORDER Qty will also update PO and I-F-1 Inventory Tab.
                    COST PER CS
                    If Cost UOM = CS, the Total Quantity Ordered will be divided by the COUNT, then mulitpled by the 
                    Cost per Case.
                    For example.

                    The TOTAL PO quantity is 10,000. So, the total cases is 10,000 / 25 = 400
                    Thus 400 Cases x $10 per Case = $4,000 Total Cost.

                    e next tag before a location. I realize this is wrong on their part but can a safe guard be put i
                    n place to not accept locations that do not exist in the system?

                    There is validation within sharp shooter Count for location.

                    en tabbed, then did the same scan in the WHSE field, then tabbed, and got an error message:
                    "Invalid Bin. Try Help."
                    Then I saved the line and got 2 more error messages:
                    "Invalid Whse...try help"
                    "Invalid Bin#. Try help"
                    But the line saved anyway and created the 0 count line for the existing location:

                    But every subsequent Tag# they scan comes up with the prompt asking 
                    "Update Item on Job File?" Yes No. 
                    It doesn?t matter if you click Yes, it still comes up with the same prompt for each roll you scan

                    Run VB2 for vendor INLAND.  Select all invoices for payment.  The ACH check format should only li
                    st 30 - 40 invoices and then page break to print the rest on a second page.  It is only listing a
                    bout 50 invoices and then stopping and not printing a second page.  See attachment.

                    3.  Look in ecodes for that code and the contact did not get added.
                    
                    It only works if you add the phone contact and save first without clicking email-notification and
                     then go back in and choose the file.

                    Double Click on Hew1000 and nothing happens.
                    This should go directly to View Tab fo that Customer.
                    
                    Any search that shows multple customers must allow double click to access the customer.

                    N-K-1 NotePad current is for all users.
                    Logical Value = YES will load reports directly to Notepad using the logic below..
                    Logical Value = NO will not Load to Notepad.
                    
                    
                    We need to be able to allow specific users to output to Notepad.
                    And other users to use traditial Advantzware Outuput.
                    
                    Character Value = __________   will output to all users.
                    
                    Character Value = NotePad.
                    N-C Change User Groups will have a Group = NotePad
                    The Body will list all the User ID's that will output to NOTEPAD.
                    Users not defined in the group ID = Notepad will output to the traditional ASI output.
Z- - -   02101509 B N-K Notepad = blank
                    Character Value = __________   will output to all users.
                    Right now if the Character value is blank it only outputs to the notepad group.
                    That is wrong and needs to output to all users.
