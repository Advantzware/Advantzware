                     default all items and Misc charges as TAXABLE, regardless of the items taxable code. When the MA
                    NDATORY TAX  field in the Ship to FIle is NO and the Customer Header screen
                    TAXABLE field is YES, then the Tax is determined by the FG items tax code.
                    
A-F-1-   05240403 E F1 on Shipto Code to Seach Customer File
                    Add new shipto.  [F1] on customer shipto  should search for valid customers from the customer fil
                    e. This will be used when the ship to BILLABLE flag is used.   
A-F-6-   08120306 E Expand tax code decimal to 3 digits
                    DB Changed with V3.0.  Now we must expand tax code decimal to 4 digits.  Need to enter tax
                    percents as 7.625.  This will require changing all programs that utilize this field including  or
                    der
                    entry, invoicing, tax reports and commissioin reports.
A-R-5-   02100403 E Aging to say Finance Charge instead of INVOICE
                    The AR Aging should show FC in the Type field instead of IN for an invoice created from a

A-R-8-   01070405 E Report to list out each individual posting
                    The bank deposit report is only printing totals for each day.  It should list out each

A-U-1-   06180416 E Make Customer Name the default radio button on customer# popup
                    Make Customer Name the default radio button on customer # popup Lisa, they never use the customer
                     # or vendor # to look up.  This is very annoying to keep having to press the other radio button 
                    on every invoice entered.
A-U-1-   10170303 E Save and automatically Add on each line item
                    At the end of each line item, if the tab or enter key are used on last field of line, automatical
                    ly go to the next line in add mode without having to save each line individually.

A-U-3-   10140424 E When entering and Invoice Number the Customer Code should appear
                    When printing AR invioce.  When entering an invoice number, the customer code should
                    default.  Currently only the save parameter shows.

                    When posting Invoices, we will save the screen selections.  The POSTING DATE should
                    always default to BLANK SPACES.  This will force the user to enter the correct date.
A-U-4-   04200404 E Save Parameters with Invoice Date as Today
                    When posting Invoices, we now save the screen selections.  The ending invoice date  should
                    default to the current date.  
                    
A-W-1-   05250408 E Do not allow entry in the applied field on return
                    Do not allow user to update the applied field on a credit memo created from an order entry

A-W-1-   09170307 E New A/R Credit Memo Browser
                    New Browser to include an inquiry feature to look up any posted item.  Similar logic to order

C-Q- -   04260404 E Add logo to Quotation for Oracle Packaging
                    J:\oraclepak.jpg  Copy Century Box Quote and name Oracle.  Use standard Font such as
                    Courier New  for headings.
D- - -   05110411 E Sort by Job/Machine/Time
                    When adding many jobs to a machine data collection,  the screen should sort
                    by Job/Machine/Time.     
D-F- -   11170406 E Autopost FG item not working when replacing Multi Dept Machine
                    N-K-1 Autopost is not prompting to enter the unit count quanity does when replacing a single
                    department machine with a machine that does multple departments including the last operation.   F
                    or example.  lets assume we estiamte and create job with the ZLM, 56 DieCut
                    and Klett Gluer to make the box.  Due to scheduling,  data collection runs the job on the
                    FLEXO, which can PR, DC, HS, and GL.  The job file only updates the ZLM with the Flexo
                    machine.  Since, the Klett Gluer is still on the machine job routing, the system does not view
                    the FLEXO as the last operation, hence will not prompt to update the FG Receipts by
                    prompting for the unit count.  I think the program should delete all machines in the job routing
                    defined for the new machine.  ie.  since the Flexo has PR, DC, HS, GL,  then the 56, HS, and
                    Klett should be deleted.
D-F- -   12050311 E Autopost to utilize AutoPDC to eliminate operations to post FG Receipt
                    Many jobs may have banding or other machines that are automatically posted via the
                    AUTOPDC function. The AUTOPOST function should not consider the last machine if the
                    machine is listed in the AUTOPDC character value.   
                    
                    For example, the AutoPDC could have Band   If the Job 1396 had the machines  Press, Haire
                    and Band, then the GLUER would be considered the last operation for automatically creating
                    finished goods receipts. Therefore, the unit count prompt should appear when RUN is done
                    on the GLUER in this example.
D-R-1-   06070405 E D-R-1 Effiency Report to Show MSF and Consolidate Downtime
                    New Option Called Show MSF and Summarize DT.  This will print to right of Quantity, which is
                    the same as Pieces Run.  To make room for this new field,  the report will combine Downttime
                    Chargeable and Downtime Non Chargabe into one Column called  DT.
                    
D-R-1-2  04190402 E D-R-12 not printing Date Range
                    When printed for a weekly period, Triad is only getting a couple of jobs to print.  When run the
                    various other data collection reports, all the jobs that were run during that time period. The
                    D.R.12 report does a reconciliation of sheets received in to finished goods out.  This is very
                    good info, but we need the information for all orders run during the time period specified. 
                    
                    
                    
D-R-1-2  06290404 E FG Report
                    Report D.R.12. has some good information. This shows a comparison of sheets received to
                    finished goods received.  The only problem is that if an order is run through the slitter, the
                    sheets received shows -0-.  Can this be modified so that the number of sheets received is
                    either the amount from data collection from the slitter for that job or the actually quantity
                     received from the vendor?  This also applies to the board reconciliation report (J.R.B.)

                    D-R-6 GUI Data Collection Labor Hours vs. Estiamtes Report.  Add option to print from date to

                    D-R-7 GUI Data Collection Downtime Analysis Report. Option to print from date range.
D-R-7-   06140403 E Break out Charge codes by description   ****INVOICED****
                    Right now this report shows Downtime charged, and downtime not charge. They would like
                    this broken out by description.  ie.. DC waiting for machine parts DC no operator available
                    NC Group meeting
D-R-7-   08090401 E Machine Charge Code by Open / Closed / All Jobs
                    I think report D.R.7. is almost what I need.  The only problem I have with the report is that it
                    works off job closed dates.  I would need it to work off from dates of postings of data collectio
                    n
                    information.  We sometimes will have large jobs that we will run part of the order this week and
                    part next week, and sometimes even into a third week.  If you could create another report like
                    this one that "grabs" information based on data collection posting dates rather than job
                    posting dates, then I believe I will have the information I am looking for.
                     
                    
D-T- -   10040405 E Data Collection to Update Job Routing Completed Flag
                    Data collection keys D-U adn D-F provide adding hours for machines.  Each MR and RUN
                    operation allow the operator to answer YES to complete each task.  When posting this data,
                    the job routing flags must be updated by job, by machine and by form / pass#. This data is
                    critical to droping machines off of the scheduling board.
D-U- -   10040409 E Data Collectin must allow 00:00 to 24:00
                    DB: When end time is 24:00, the system shows an error message.
E- - -   02030401 E Estimate Folder Purchased/Manf.
                    DB Field.  Purchased / Manufactured Flag as the last field on the estimate folder.   
                    
                    Eventually this will trigger separate logic for estimate calculating and order entry to create th
                    e FG item and purchase order for the FG item.
E- - -   02170411 E Estimate IMAGE Update Button to utilze current M/S Paint
                    IMAGE update button to show entire CAD image via the M/S Paint on the existing computer. 
                    Currenly the image will only show a partial image of the CAD drawing.
E- - -   05110401 E Label Change for BOM
                    Estimating Layout Folders for Corrugated and Folding.  Change lables on the BOM button
                    from Medium , Liner, Medium, Liner  to Paper 1, Paper 2 , Paper 3,  Paper 4,  etc. These fields
                    can be used for laminating so this will be more user friendly.
E- - -   05240410 E Add FROM Estimate to right of original estimate it was copied from
                    On Spec Folder,  add FROM:  999999  to show original estimate number that the new estimate
                    was copied from.  This is for both folding and corrugated.
E- - -   07130409 E Expand Estimate # to 6 Digits
                    Estimate Control file allows 6 Digits.  Clients are nearing the end of 5 digits.  Hopefully addin
                    g
                    digit is not to much trouble.  Change estimate, order entry, job costiing,  reports ?
E- - -   12150304 E TEMP Customer shipt logic for all customers
                    Move logic for adding TEMP Shipto's to all customers.  For new TEMP customer shipto
                    addresses, the SAVE button prompts to create all the neccessary address information. This
                    should be the same logic for any customer.
                    
E-B-1-   09230419 E Machiine File:  Add Scheduling Machine and update via Job Creation
                    Add new Ref field called Schedule Machine on the Machine Screen.  Move Industry Down to
                    Right of the Sequence and put the field called Schedule Machine:  on top right. Whenever a
                    job is created, the schedule machine code will replace the estimated machine.  Do not
                    change any machine standards, just the machine code. This is critical to Scheduling.
                    Many clients call a machine my multiple names.  6C could be 6C, 6C1X, 6X2X, 6CNP which
                    may mean 6 color, 6 color 1 xtra man, 6 color 2 Xtra men,  6 Colro No Printing, respectively.
                    They do this for unique costs and standards, etc.\
                    
E-B-3-   03020409 E Add to Corrugated Style File field called Qty/Set
                    DB Field was added.   Add to both style files called QTY/SET.  This will default to the
                    estimate folder when adding two piece box estimates or other boxes such as partitions that
                    could be a standard 2,3 or 4 qty per set.
E-B-3-   09220409 E Corr Style Routing Copy should have F1 on Style Codes.

E-B-8-   01300408 E Prep and die file, last used field should update via order entry
                    When an order or job is created for an estimate, the plate and die# defined on the Spec
                    Folder should be updated in the die file. The last used field should be updated with the Job

E-C- -   01050402 E Set Match Markup to use new field
                    Currently, the set matching markup imports from the N-K-1 SETPRINT integer value.  This is
                    now a separate field in the estimate print screen.  Changes to this new field should be used in
                    the set calculation.   If the user changes the set markup on the estimate calculation, this
                    percentage should be saved and displayed the next time the estimate calculation is run.
E-C- -   02140305 E Display User ID when the estimate was last modified.
                    1) Display User ID on Estimate Browser in new Gui program to display the last User ID that
                    modified the estimate.  Any time one of the folders were updated, the user ID would be
                    updated.   
                    
                    2) Add the User ID to the estimate by size report E-R-8 as the last field.

E-C- -   02170409 E Allow 20 Panels on Box Design
                    Jeff did DB changes and expanded Spec Folder Panels.  Need ability to add up to 20
                    panels and print this landscape mode. The box panel dimensions may need to scroll on the
                    box design screen.
E-C- -   02260404 E Remove corriguation direction from factory ticket (ARTIOS)
                    When the estimate has a cad#, they do not want the corrugation direction to print on the ticket.
E-C- -   03040410 E Estimated View not calculating Paper Cost
                    View the Print Folder for Estimate 2119. The paper material 26#M-80 , which has an estimated
                    UOM of MSF is showing zero cost for each roll material.  This is a REAL material so I assume
                    that it is trying to import the acutal cost, but shows no cost.  Change logic to utilize the pric
                    e
                    matrix if it is defined, otherwise use the actual cost from the inventory file. We should also ad
                    d
                    the option to select a specific Vendor for Paper Material. In summary, the cost would come
                    from a specific vendor matrix or blank vendor matrix if defined, otherwise the cost would come
                    from the actual last cost.
E-C- -   03300402 E New Icon to Show Stack Pattern
                    New button called Stack Pattern on the INK/PACK folder.  When the button is pressed, the 
                    stack pattern code on the screen will point to the stack pattern image listed in the Stack
                    Pattern Image File.  First, Expand Stack Pattern Image field to support:
                    R:\ASI_GUI\Rcode\ASIIMAGE\PATTERNS\Pinwheel.jpg
                    Also Add F1 Lookup to image file similar to Box design image lookup.
E-C- -   03300403 E Box Design Images Default to BitMap
                    Box images default to Bitmap on my computer and Morgans. They should always default to
                    .JPE otherwise we cannot view in MS Paint.  This is a problem when pressing the IMAGE
                    UPDATE button.
E-C- -   03300412 E ShtCalc to support more characters.
                    The N-K-1 SHT CALC  logical value dictates to search for the first 3 characters of the item
                    name.  We should expand this to 10 characters.  Once changed, I could still just type 3 character
                    s or 10 characters to limit the sort.
E-C- -   04190408 E Corrugate Estimate endless loop if Stack Pattern does not exist
                    If stack patterns are deleted or new stack patterns added, but the estimate program cannot
                    find the new pattern in the stack matrix, an endless loop exists and the program freezes.
E-C- -   05130411 E Print Estimates by Date
                    When viewing or printing estimates, group by probe date. The CERUN = Mclean format
                    shows 5 quantities at the bottom of the estimate. This should only show estimates for the
                    probe date highlighted before pressing the View or Hardcopy button.
E-C- -   05280404 E Import Qty/Set to Estimate folder.
                    The corrugated style file has new fields that should transfer to the estimate.  Qty/set, 5th Pane
                    l,
                    Tuck, DK Width, DK lenght, and Lock Tab should transfer from the style file to both the
                    estimate folder and spec folder when autocalculating.
E-C- -   07130412 E Update Test or Flute to Search for New Board Code
                    New logic to prompt "Find new Board material?"  whenever the Flute or Test is changed on
                    the Estimate or Spec Folder. The system should find the first estimated material for that flute
                    and test just like in add mode.  It currently finds the current board material.  If I change C 20
                    0 to
                    B 200, the program prompt for  200 C.  This should find 200 B. I like the board popup screen,
                    just focus on the first flute, test.
E-C- -   08130405 E New SHEET cross grain logic to rotate sheet but not grain.
                    Move folding carton logic for SHEET cross grain to the Corrugated estimating. This will keep
                    the corrugated grain direction the same as the blank grain direction, but allow the sheet to be
                    rotated on the machine to run the sheet through the machine cross grain, but the blank lenght
                    and sheet length will remain consistent.
E-C- -   08170402 E New SHEET cross grain machine limits to look at Net Sheet
                    See Estimate 2398.  The Layout cross grain is SHEET cross grain.  The layout and net sheet
                    and gross sheet are perfect.  The machine routing will not import the ZLM because the gross
                    sheet is 49" and the machine limits are 30 ".  The net sheet size fits the ZLM machine, hence
                    the Front to Back warning on the BUILD routing screen is invalid.
E-C- -   08230405 E Programs that run cec/descalc.p

                    additional pages for the box designs.
E-C- -   08290304 E Set Match Markup to extract from Component Price
                    Currently, the set matching markup imports from the N-K-1 SETPRINT integer value. This is
                    now a separate field in the estimate print screen.  Changes to this new field should be used in
                    the set calculation.  Also, the set match markup is imbedded into the selling price for each
                    component. The summary page shows the cost for the matching markup with each
                    components cost.
                    
                    Although the calculation is correct, the total set cost does not appear to total correctly on the
                    
                    summary page because the cost for each component do not add up to the set total. Hence,
                    the set matching markup should not be included in the cost for each component.  Simply show

                    exclude the matching markup for each form, then the summary page will total each
                    component plus the matching markup.
E-C- -   12030201 E Combo Logic for Sets
                    POP displays require mulitple items on a single sheet of board.  This could be just one part of 
                    the set.  The routing logic would be similar to folding carton combination logic, whereby the
                    form is routed then each blank is routed separately.  Add logic to add items for a form as part
                    of a set. When pressing Add Button, Then Add Item to Form.   We need the Number Out, S/B
                    fields identical to Fold Combos.  Add S/B, Width # Out, Lenght # Out, Colors: Forms,  Passes,
                    Coating: Forms, Passes, Die Inches. Also, Layout screen should only show one form if
                    mulitple items are for same form. Update Button should work like Folding Combo showing
                    S/B, Number up, Etc.
E-C- -   12060414 E Lock Up Logic in Estimating SET Button
                    Leave estimate print folder on the calculate screen waiting to enter estimate quantities.
                    Login and access same estimate. 2nd User clicks the SET button and Update will be logout
                    to main menu.
E-C- -   12100308 E Delete item on Set Estimate to Renumber Items with outstanding orders.
                    Allow deletion of an item on a set with a prompt to delete the item.  Once deleted, the estimate
                    will renumber the part numbers as well as the machine routing. This will not be possible if the
                    FG Items exist or an order exists, hence this will not prompt for this logic. To renumber FG item
                    
                    for an existing job would triple the work. Please note, single items will not allow deleting an
                    item.

                    DB changes done for RCO300 on the Spec Foler to allow up to 20 panels.  Add data base
                    fields if required.  Need ability to add up to 20 panels and print this landscape mode.
                    The box panel dimensions may need to scroll on the box design screen.

                    2029 has been overriden.  When you override the blank the system ask if you would like to
                    update the sheet size, but even if you answer yes, the sheet size has not been changed. 
                    When Overriding, blank dimensions,  ASSUME NO NESTING.  Simply use total blank length
                    and total blank width to determine sheet size against thelayout machine limitations.
E-F- -   01280407 E Label Changes to Layout Number Out

                    BUILD button on Folding routing screen with mulltiple routings for multiple quantities.  When
                    you are rebuilding and if you have several quantities, you have to rebuild each one
                    individually.  In character, it used to ask, if the rebuild was for this quantity or all quantiti

E-F- -   02180408 E New Dayton BOL
                    New XPRINT2 Bill of Lading Logic.   Add logic to save print selection parameters.
                    1) New print selection called   Print Cases ___   Pallets ______  Currently, we print the total
                    number of pallets.  New logic will print Total cases on the form.  This logic can be retrieved
                    from the current Dayton form that is a DOS format. 2)  The Address prints when the logical
                    value is YES.  When the shipto address is set to BROKER, then the Sold to address on the
                    order will print in place of the customer X addresss. The old ASI format had this logic. We
                    originally quoted chaging the Fibre BOL, then to add Company name we changed to
                    XPRINT2.  Evelyn did not know that Xprint existed.
E-F- -   02180410 E New Dayton Invoice 461
                    See sample. Copy Xprint Invoice to Dayton.  Add discount and % under the descriptioin.
                    Also, the price each should be the list price and the discount will be under .

                    They would like to be able to have a requested and yield quantity for single item estimates.  Thi
                    s allows them to quote a single item, knowing they will have to run it in combo at a later date. 
                     This will work the same way requested and yield quantities work for combo's
E-F- -   03100411 E Combo Layout cannot be Entered
                    See estimate 2130,  Also see sample Layout, which is a real die layout.  This cannot be
                    added without the system recalculating the GOTO layout and yield.  The yield quantity is all
                    that matters. The requested quantity does not need to make any sense at all.   When I press
                    NO to calculate on the request qty,  NO calculation should occur.
E-F- -   03150405 E Print Net Sheet on estimate
                    All folding estimates should print Net Sheet on estimate hard copy between  Die Size and Gross Sh
                    eet.  Change Sheet Size label to Gross Sheet.    On tandem and combo estimates, add blank size.
                    
                    On the Net sheet, also show the number out.   No need to print the square feet and weight since t
                    his is listed on the gross sheet.
E-F- -   05130404 E Import BOM for folding board
                    Add estimate with board code SBS1033-26. The medium and liner should import to the BOM
                    folder on the layout along with the shrink percentage.  Ideally, we could also default the flute
                    code and both glue materials. Needed for Accurate Box who laminates SBS10 point to
                    medium and liner material. They want to just enter the board code and have everything
                    default.
E-F- -   05130412 E Print Estimates by Date
                    When viewing or printing estimates, group by probe date.  The CERUN = Mclean format
                    shows 5 quantities at the bottom of the estimate.  This should only show estimates for the

                    could be empty.  For combination jobs, a change to any inks will update all other inks on that
                    form. Tandem jobs will require the print station unit# for each ink. Adding new estimates or copy
                     estimates or created estimates from tandem will copy the print station unit# for each ink. 
                    NEW COPY BUTTON on the INK folder  will prompt to copy all the inks AND / OR  the Station
                    Numbers for each ink.  
                    
E-F- -   05190411 E Estimate Browser to sort by Estimate Type
                    New Toggle Boxes on Estimate Browser called  Single, Set, Tandem, Combo.  Default will be
                    with all item checked.  When the GO button is pressed, the program will display the number of
                    records defined on the CEBROWSER option. The estimate type field is not indexed,
                    therefore, selection the entire list would be very slow, hence we will display the number of
                    records from the CEBROWSER integer value.
E-F- -   06110403 E Estimate Calculation to total Weight for all board and Paper
                    See Estimate 2314. The only way the total weight works is with a board code combining all the
                    weights.  Accurate Box wants to enter just SBS-18, then BOM to update the medium and liner.
                    trhe Print folder, should add the basis weight for each board and paper material plus, starch
                    and laminate. We need to add a Wt/MSF field for the starch and resin material.  ie material
                    types G and L.
E-F- -   06300409 E Need Logic for slitting per cutting after printing.
                    Add new Number Out to the Layout Folder. This will import the Department GU to the machine
                    routing screen. Therefore, the ream cutting machine in the RC department must be copied to
                    the GU department.  In summary, the RC deparmtent will use the Number out on the gross
                    sheet and import an RC machine and the number out on the Net Sheet will import the GU
                    deparmtent.

                    Add Master estimate number per EB Blank Item to each Order/Job.   This would allow changes to the
                     FG item file to automatically update the estimate on the FG item file as well as the Master Esti
                    mate number.  
                    
                    Please note, this need not be shown, just stored in the database for use when updating the order 
                    so that the new estimate and old estimate are updated.

                    one item. Currently, each component creates a separate pallet and a separate case for each
                    component. That could happen but most often they are shipped as a set.  I am doing a Setup
                    Box / Rigid Box demo and The items most ofter will ship as a set. When Set is Assembled
                    then all the components would ship a a single unit.  ie.  1st items case and packing info should
                    transfer to all components. Just use the first items packing info. Only changes should be

                    Print Prep and Die costs from the Prep / Routing file to print the cost just one time.  The prep
                    costs have no cost matrix, hence the costs are the same for all quantities. This will require

                    the cost for each quantity is only valid for MISC items from the Misc / Farm matrix.  The costs
                    entered on the top matrix may be entered on a /M basis hence the cost could change for
                    different quantities.  Hence keep the logic to print cost for each quantity for the MISC costs

                    Run a block of financials at one time, instead of having to  call up each one at a time ?  We typ
                    ically run a set of 13 reports routinely, so a range of Financial Report names would be handy. e.
                    g.  PL01  through  PL04.  The date box to the right could remain, since all the reports being run
                     in the range would be at the same date anyway.

                    Goods Sold should be a db field so that we can store the GL numbers when the report is reprinted.

                    or each month, plus YTD totals.  This will simply run a P&L financial report that has been writte
                    n by Hughes.  The software would simply run the current period date range for each month then run
                     the report again for the next month.    Each run will generate each column.

                    Print YTD totals?  Yes/No.  Also, when printing with Invoice Posting Date the report is much slow
                    er then by Invoice date. Any way to speed this report up.  We have nearly no invoices for June an
                    d it takes 1 minute.

                    mal, the F1 lookup on the job# should show only jobs for that item. Also, add exiting warehouse, 
                    bin location and quantity on hand for the location. Lastly, when selecting a job for an item, the
                      unit count and units / pallet should also transfer to the physical count screen. Add item HER-2
                    497 for Tag HER-1297  00006.  This imports the correct warehouse / Bin.

                    totals will add to each Month totals and to the Year to date total.

                    Report use to print for FG item Sell Price.   In october we changed this for Dayton to print from
                     the job file / orders sell price.
                    
                    Add both options.
I-U-1-   07160410 E FG Sets to Roll up costs for All Components

I-U-3-   06280408 E FG Adjustments reopens Jobs
                    When I do finished good adjustments, the jobs are automatically reopened.  It seems to me that in
                     most cases when you do an adjustment you would not want to reopen jobs (correcting a finished go
                    od receipt, disposing of overrun, discovering that inventory placed on floor is defective, etc.).
                      Can this be changed to provide a question as to whether or not you want jobs reopened when post
                    ing adjustments or changing the logic so that jobs are not opened when posting finished good adju
                    stments? FG Adjustments do not reopen jobs. When doing adjustments to jobs it may be necessary to
                     do a negative receipt if you need to update the GL that was created.  I which case you must reop
                    en the job to create GL numbers.  Otherwise, a simple adjustment to a FG Bin that has a job# will
                     not affact the job at all. 
                    
I-W- -   04020410 E Transaction date should run for only that time frame
                    New Logic for Month End.  New option to called Close Month.    If this is unchecked, then the pro
                    gram will calculate the PTD totals for the FG Item TOTALS folder.    Only the last day of each pe
                    riod may be enterd as the transaction date.   Hence if the date 03/31/04, then all transactions i
                    n that period will be totaled and written to the TOTALS folder. When the CLOSE MONTH button is ch
                    ecked, then the program will clear out the PTD totals and calculate the YTD totals for the curren
                    t year entered.   Hence, if 03/31/04 date is entered and Close Month is checked, all transactions
                     from the 1st day of the current year to the transaction date entered will update the YTD totals 
                    buttons.   Any date entered other than the last date of each period will display warning message 
                    that the date is invalid. The FG history file should contain all the data to produce the TOTALS n
                    umbers.

                    on the report.  I've double checked to see if these are closed and they are. How can I get an acc
                    urate WIP report with only open jobs? Open WIP means you need to run J-W to create the GL for job
                    .  If you wish I can add Job Status toggle boxes to only show Open, Closed or All like the other 
                    reports do.

J-U-1-   05210405 E Sheet Calc Button in Job File + Auto Issue Board to Job
                    Requested by Patty:
                    Sheet Calc button in job file similar to the corrugated estimating sheet calc logic.   The user w
                    ould need to select a machine from the job routing for the form / sheet selected when pressing th
                    e SHEET CALC button on the job material screen.
                    Please note, this logic must also work for folding estimates, since the job file does not disting
                    uish between corrugated or folding carton jobs.  Reference Task 05210405.  This will allow people
                     to go into the job file, do a sheet calc on the material file for board.  After they choose the 
                    material, it will give them the option to issue that material to the job.  This is how we are pic
                    turing this would work.  Go to J-U pull up job number, go to  material file.  A button on the scr

                    tly, to update the job standards, the job must be opened, and then later closed, which creates ma

                    ormally transfer from the customer order, however many jobs are created without customer orders. 
                     I would have the order update the new due date field, however it would only be updated when the 
                    job does not show a customer order. This would make the due date print on job backlog reports and
                     scheduling without the need of a customer order.

M-U-2-   02190419 E Raw Material Issue by Diameter
                    New Unit of Measure called DIA  or  Diameter for  Folding Board  and Paper Material and Corrugate
                    d Paper Material.  Raw Mat'l will show the database field called Regular Number (Reg#)  as Core D
                    iameter.  This will allow entering a postive or negative issue of a specific roll by simply enter
                    ing the remaining diameter.   Logic is invoked when the UOM DIA on issues and the remaining diame
                    ter inches such as 40.25 for 40 1/4 inch.   this will be the diameter of the roll remaining from 
                    side to side of the roll ,  After the UOM of DIA is entered, the system will prompt for the Core 
                    diameter, which is the diameter of the internal core that the paper is spun around.  This will im
                    port fromt the material file if defined.   Once this data has been entered, the acutal consumptio
                    n UOM and quantity will be calculated by the system.
                    For example, the program would automatically calculate the total MSF or LF or TON simply by enter
                    ing the diameter.   The job would retain the sheet width and lenght and the item file would conta
                    in the basis weight and core diameter for use in the calculation. Formual is as follows  R=Roll D
                    iameter, D=Core Diameter,  C=Caliper
                      (  (  (R*R) - (D*D)   X .0655  )   /   Caliper ) =  Lineal Feet Remaining on the Roll
                    Please note, for Postivie Issues we must Subtract the Original Receipt LF plus all Issue LF
                    For MSF.   Take Beginning MSF minus Remaining MSF  ( LF x 12 x Roll width /144)
                    The Beginnging LF or MSF must substact all other issues for that TAG Number.

                    The job has the paper 26#M-80 on the job.   I received 26#M-80 to many tag numbers.   Next, I iss
                    ued the complete tag to the job.   Since the roll (Tag#) was only  1/2 the roll is consummed. 
                    To put this back  into inventory, I must do a negative issue.

                    the program should default the S/B from the Job Material File.     If multiple items exist, then 
                    the SAVE or tab to the S/B field would popup the FG Items to issue to.

N-K-1-   02260402 E N-K OEPrep  Charges to be deleted from estimate by Form Number
                    New option to delete Prep Changes from the Estimate.   When the logical value is YES, the prep ch
                    arges will be deleted.  If the logical value is NO, then the prep charges will be changed to "N"o
                     Charge from "B"illable.  Please note, the amoritization percentage must be 100%, otherwise, the 
                    prep code will remain for future billing.   When the simon code is an "S",  after the first order
                     has been billed for the line item pertaining to that forms prep charge,  the prep charges will b
                    e deleted from the estimate.  .   Please note, if the prep charges are billed by Form#, then the 
                    prep charge would be deleted based on the FG item that was billed.   Therefore, if the first item
                     was billed, then only the plate charge for that item/form should be billed, hence only that prep
                     item should be deleted from the estimate.
N-K-1-   03030407 E N-K OEDATE  Is order date modifiable?
                    New system control parameter called OEDATE.   Yes will allow the order header date to be modified
                    .  No  will not.  When you ADD   an order the date that the system assigns to the order (order da
                    te) will be not be modifiable.  This would need a system flag so that current users who do not wa

                    POEXPORT will have a new option called HRMS.  This will transfer the purchase order data directly
                     to the HRMS system in the HRMS specified format.

N-K-1-   03080410 E N-K TSPOST.   Option to Post Actural Crew Cost or Standards Cost

                    uld read.  Post Actual or Standard Direct Labor Costs.    Current logic would be Standard which t
                    ransfers the actual crew and updates the Advantzware Data Collection module, which will post to t
                    he job cost and WIP at the standard DL rate, Variable O/H and Fixed O/H  from the machine file.
                    New logic for ACTUAL direct labor will post the labor rate for each person on each job directly t
                    o the Job Cost / WIP.   The total hours will continue to post the machine files Fixed O/H and Var
                    iable O/H.     Hence this would no longer require posting to job cost / WIP via Advantzware D-T h
                    ot keys.    The TSPost would post directly to the Advantzware job cost / WIP at actual Direct Lab
                    or Costs, but Standard Fixed and Variable O/H rates.
                    LOGICAL VALUE will turn this feature ON or OFF.   Default to NO, which would post the Touch Scree
                    n transactions to the Advantzware data collection with the STANDARD RATES only.      Logical valu
                    e = YES would post directly to WIP  based on the character value of either actual or standard rat
                    es based on the character value.
                    BUGS:
                    Update Button and VIEW update must update machine and employee transactions.  Add mode creates bo
                    th, but update on data collection does not delete and change machine and employee transactions.

N-K-1-   04050404 E N-K FGITEM#  Add Option called Part#
                    Character version shows only NONE and Manual.    GUI version does not show NONE and manual import
                    s the customer part#, but does not allow changing the FG Item code.    When I enter the estimate 
                    numbe of the header, the program defaults the FG item to the line item screen and does not allow 
                    any changes.   Clearly the word MANUAL is not correct.  The FG Item should default, but be update
                    able.  HOP paid to allow them to enter the FG item number if it does not exist.   I believe this 
                    is the NONE version.    When adding an estimate without a FG item code, the order entry program w
                    ill leave the FG Item code BLANK and then prompt to enter the FG Item code.
N-K-1-   05140404 E N-K JOBCARDF = FibreFC

                    BOLD typed Department Notes and indent actual department notes.     
                    New logic for Inks.   Each ink will be numbered 1-99 for each pass.  If an ink such as BLACK is l
                    isted twice for an individual blank on the items ink folder, then the ink will be listed twice on
                     the job ticket.  The black inks will have two numbers.      The inks used for each FG item will 
                    be listed by number on the right column of the job ticket.
                    For example.  
                    Item 1 has two passes as follows:
                    Pass 1   P-Black ,  P-Black,  P-Cyan, P-Yellow, P-Magenta,  AQ Coating

N-K-1-   05270404 E N-K INVDATE to create the Invoice Date as Current Date vs BOL Date
                    New option to create Invoice date as either the BOL Date or Current Date.   Current logic creates
                     the invoice date as the BOL date, hence the character value will be BOLDATE.   New logic will us
                    e the character value of INVDATE.   
                    
                    Therefore, if the BOL date is May 21, but the invoice is created on May 27, the Invoice date woul
                    d be created with the current date of 05-27-04.
N-K-1-   05270407 E N-K BOLDATE to create the BOL Date as Current Date vs Release Date
                    New option to create BOL date as either the Release Date or Current Date.   Current logic creates
                     the BOL date as the RELEASE date from the release screen, hence the character value will be RELE
                    ASEDATE.   New logic will use the character value of POSTDATE.   
                    Therefore, if the Release date is May 21, but the release is created on May 27, the BOL date woul
                    d be created with the current date of 05-27-04.

                    The logical value dictates if the AP post date will import as blank or with todays computer date.
                      The Character Value allows the users to define a date in the character value to validate agains
                    t a date entered on the Accounts Payable posting data entered.   If the date value entered in the
                     POSTDATE character value is 05-31-05, then the date entered on the AP posting screen must be aft
                    er 5/31/04.    Hence only a date of 06-01-04 or later would be valid.
N-K-1-   06190309 E N-K OEAUTOFG to auto create Purchase Orders for FG

                    ly ordering board for jobs.   Once the vendor is selected, the purchase order will be created wit
                    h the FG item, Order Qty will equal the Purchase Order Quantitty,  Cost,  size, item name, descri
                    ption and Order number transferred to the PO.  Likewise the cost will transfer back to the custom
                    er order.   Prompt for PO Date and Due Date prior to creating the PO.
                    Lastly prompt for PO Type.  Normal or Drop Ship.   Drop Ship will prompt for the normal drop ship
                     logic.  If the vendor matrix is not created, the program will prompt for the purchase cost.
                    Please note, the general ledger number will also transfer to the purchase with the same logic as 
                    when adding the finished goods manually to the purchase order.
                    Also,  character value dictates when to create PO.   Southpak only want to create PO if FG Stocke

                    red to obtain the next board cost break. 
                    For example.   Lets assume we order 1500 sheets of 200C that are 24x36 or  6 SF and 9 MSF.
                    We will assume that the board has a cost of $40 up to 4.999 MSF,  $38 up to 9.999 MSF and $35 up 
                    to 20 MSF.   The PO would import the cost of $38 / MSF.   This modification would show the next c
                    ost break at $35 per MSF for 10MSF, which would calculate into  1667 Sheets.
                    Formula is MSF x 1000 / Sheet Square Feet = Sheets   or 10 x 1000 / 6 = 1666.666

                     this order to determine how many complete sets have been created, but not invoiced.  Therefore, 
                    the last component shipped to compete the set will trigger the invoice to be created.   If no set

                    een will show both the set as well as all the components.  Each component may be shipped individu
                    ally in any quantity just as current  items are shipped.  When the bill of lading is posted the c
                    omponent inventory will be reduced and the program will check create an invoice and reduce the se
                    t item quantity on hand that can be invoiced. This logic will search all components shipped on th
                    is order to determine how many complete sets have been created, but not invoiced. Therefore, the 
                    last component shipped to compete the set will trigger the invoice to be created.  If no sets hav
                    e been completed, then no invoice will be created for the set item.   Please note, when invoicing
                     an unassembled set under this scenario, only the components shipped on the last bill of lading w
                    ill be reduced from the on hand quantity.  Whenever invoicing an unassembled set, the sets on han
                    d balance and quantity allocated will be reduced as the current logic current exists.  During ord
                    er entry, the component items will not allow deleteing the component item.  In update mode, the i
                    tems unit count may be changed.  When adding a unassembled set which is set to ship components se
                    parately,  each component relese will be created whenever the set scheduled release is create.  E
                    ach release quantity may be changed.  Likewise, the order quantity will be automatically created 
                    by mulitpliing the set order quantity by the quantity / set defined in set maintenance.

                    New option when scanning finished goods receipts via the sharp shooter software.  
                    Logical Value set to YES will prompt for the Tag# then prompt for the Warehouse/Bin.  If this is 
                    blank, then the warehouse and bin location will import the defualt location as Advantzware.  Same
                     logic as when pressing Back TAB.    If the warehouse cleck presses ENTER, then the default wareh
                    ouse/bin imported will be saved and the program will prompt for the next pallet tag number.
                    Logical Value = No will prompt for the Tag#, then import the Whareshouse and Bin from the load Ta
                    g File.   If this is blank, then the warehouse and bin location will import the defualt location 
                    as Advantzware.  Same logic as when pressing Back TAG.   Finanlly, after importing a default ware
                    house and bin, the save the line and Prompt for the next Tag#.
                    To test, add SS FG receipt for item 6x6x6NEW.   This has a blank warehouse and bin in the load ta

                    arameter indicates, this will receive finished goods by the case label.      The logic erases the
                     tag number so that the client can enter the number of cases. System is not prompting for the num
                    ber of units.  Also, when SSFGSCAN logical value is yes,  this must prompt for the warehouse and

                    ing will summarize the print out by FG item number.   Hence, if multiple job numbers and/ or mult
                    iple tag # or bin locations are shown on the bill of lading lines, the bill of lading form will o
                    nly show 1 finished goods item, but show total number of pallets, cases and unique case counts.

                    icket will summarize the print out by FG item number.   Hence, if multiple job numbers and/ or mu
                    ltiple tag # or bin locations are shown on the release lines, the release ticket form will only s
                    how 1 finished goods item, but show total number of pallets, cases and unique case counts.

                    Character value will be STOCK or PURCHASE.  Current existing logic will be STOCK, which is the St
                    ock / Consumption UOM and that will be the default when our software creates this control paramet
                    er so that existing clients programs work the same.  Of course, this may require constantly chang
                    ing the purchased unit of measure during purchasing. Please note,estimated raw materials may not 
                    have the INVENTORY folder fields defined, hence the purchasing quantity would default to EA for e
                    ach.  This may be fine for purchased sheets but may not be ideal for rolls, foam, ink, etc. The c

                    Character value as PURCHASE is reccomended so that clients may set the Purchased quantity unit of
                     measure.  Just be be clear, this is the first modifiable UOM on the purchase order line. For raw
                     goods, this could be EA, MSF, TON, LB, M, etc, whereas for finished goods this could be M, C, EA

Hot Keys Task#    T Overview
-------- -------- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Utility to change the Ship Method for all FG items in the system.
N-R-1-   11300417 E util/fxnegtag.r. & util/fxpartag.rTo transfer postive bin to negative
                    Due to SS bugs, many FG items have tag numbers with a positive bin location and a negative bin lo
                    cation.  Since this could be a useful utility.   Create utility to search for negative quantity t
                    ag numbers, the transfer this quantity to the same tag# to the bin location with a positive tag n
                    umber.  ALSO, the partial units have not transferred, hence need to be moved to the bin location 
                    with the multiple unit bin.  FG Item FAVEDEN0005 shows both a - 10000 for tag 0002 in on bin and 
                    a positive 10000 in a different location.  This should be impossible since the BOL should scan th
                    e correct tag#.
N-R-1-   12070402 E util/fxporqty.r  Must run util/fxporqty.r to fix po lines.
                    This utility fixes PO Quantity.    Add display while this is running showing the PO# or Item# tha
                    t is being fixed.     If this took awhile, clients may abort, because the screen justs sits there
                    .
N-R-1-   12140412 E util/fxpuruom.r  Set All Raw Goods and Finished Goods Purchase UOM to
                    Set All Raw Goods and Finished Goods Purchase UOM to EA.    
N-R-1-   12210402 E UTIL/FGCAPS.r
                    Write utility that will capitalize all letters in the FG item code.
N-R-1-   12290409 E util/upmstest.r  To update all non master estimates.
                    Add utility that allows the user to enter the master tandem estimate number.   The utility progra
                    m will then search each item on the estimate number and for each FG item code will update all tan
                    dem estimates with that item code with the Master Estimate Number.
                    
                    For example.  The master estimate number 100 has the finished goods item codes Apple, Cherry, Blu
                    eberry.    Every other tandem estimate with the FG item code Cherry will now have the FROM estima
                    te as 100.   The master estimate will have NO FROM estimate number.
N-R-3-   04120416 E Batch Printing with Edit Ability to Batch w/Printer Defaults Saved
                    New BATCH button for the O-R-5, H-L and H-W sales reports.  Other reports may be added for an add
                    itional 1/2 hour per report.  This new logic will allow selecting the report options such as a sa
                    lesman range or item number range and save the print selections to a file for printing in a batch
                    .  The program will also save the printer name default and the number of copies to print.  Lastly
                    , the user will be allowed to name the Batch program such as JoesDailySales.  The print selection
                    s may be modified or deleted and new print selections may be added to the batch.    Each night, a
                    n operator will execute the batch printing process, which will print each selection saved to the 
                    batch procedure.  Once each print selection is printed, the next report will print until all repo
                    rts have printed.
                    PLEASE NOTE,  MAKE SURE ENOUGH PAPAER HAS BEEN LOADED TO THE PRINTER prior to starting the batch 
                    process.  This new batch process may run at the end of the day and the reports will be available 
                    in the morning.
N-R-3-   06250407 E Batch File Updating Date Parameters
                    Batch File under N-R-1 UPDATE button will allow changing a single selection, then will PROMPT to 
                    update all batches with the same Program Name?  This will then automatically update the date rang
                    e for every batch that had already been created.
                    NO OTHER PARAMETERS WILL BE CHANGED.  ONLY THE DATE RANGE.
N-Y-1-   10010408 E N-R util/updest.r  Update Utility to Add Machine for each Form
                    Add new toggle box called Add Machine and allow to F1 on Machine code.  This new utility will add
                     this machine code to every Estimate in the system for each form on the routing screen.    Hence 
                    sets would add this machine for each form.  The machne should be added in the proper deparment se
                    quence.  The New Palletizer Machine should be defined as the LAST department in the N-Z departmen
                    t file,  hence this machine will always be added to the end of each routing.
                    
                    
N-Y-8-   12030308 E Utility is too Slow

O-R-1-5  11260302 E New Freight Report
                    New freight report generated from order invoicing to show the following fields:
                    
                    Job #    FG #            Quantity      # of Skids      Wt/100         Total Freight Charge
                     
                    This will calculate the freight cost regardless of the freight payment code. Hence, prepaid, bill
                    able, third party or collect codes will print on this report.
                    This is the cost of freight based on the quantity shipped and wt/100.    
                     
                    Freight cost is calculated based on the Truck/Carrier on the bill of lading and the cost per pall
                    et or cost per 100 pounds from the Truck/Carrier file.  The Bill of lading freight is always calc
                    ulated from the weight/100 from the finished goods item record.  When adding an order for an esti
                    mate, when the system creates a new finished good item, the weight / 100 boxes is donwloaded to t
                    he new item in the finished goods item file.   Items manually added or items such as Foam may nee
                    d to be modified in the FG item file.  The quantity of goods and number of pallets shipped on the
                     bill of lading will automatically calculate the weight and hence the cost of freight.   The frei
                    ght cost may be changed either on the bill of lading or directly on the invoice, hence the cost o
                    f freight on the estimate may vary from the freight cost on the invoice if the cost was changed b
                    y on the bill of lading or invoice screen.

              Completed By Date & Programmer    Customer Report      Page:  26

Hot Keys Task#    T Overview
-------- -------- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Clients like Pizzera Uno corporate office places blanket orders for many restraurants.  Each ship
                    to location becomes a billable customer.  Since the corporate office is on the order, the selling
                     price imports based on the corporate office.  In reality, each shipto location may have a unique
                     selling price per case defined in the stock matrix.  New logic for billl of lading posting would
                     check the stock matrix price for shipto locations that are billable customers. The customer on t
                    he order would be different than the bill to on the bill of lading, therefore the invoice would r
                    eset the selling price based on the price matrix.   If the billable shipto customer had no define
                    d stock matrix price, then the sell price on the order would transfer to the invoice.
                    Please note, the FG item file must define the item as a STOCK BOX to invoke this logic.  Likewise
                    , the shipto code must be defined as BILLABLE.
O-S-5-   07090406 E Bill of Lading Post to create Partial Unit
                    1)  Create Release for qty = 5 for item 10x10x10.  This will create a partial unit on the BOL for
                     5.  This should create 1 unit at 5.   This improves the appearance of the BOL and properly updat
                    es the FG bin file. 2)  If I post the BOL with only a partial, the system creates a -partial of -
                    5.  This should reduce the number of units by 1 and create a partial of 45, which substracts 5 fr
                    om the unit count of 50. Create a partial pallet when posting bill of ladings from a full pallet 
                    / unit count.  Hence if we have 10 units at 500 and we ship 50 boxes, then the partial unit would
                     show 450 and the unit count would show 500.  Therefore, the inventory would show 9 units at 500 
                    and 1 partial at 450. Likewise if we were to ship 600, then we would have a partial unit of 400 a
                    nd 8 units at 500. 5000 - 600 = 4400.  4400 / 500 = 8 units of 500 and a partial of 400.  
                    Hence the logic must take the total quantity shipped and divide by the unit count.   If the balan
                    ce is greater than the unit count then add a partial unit if the balance is less than the unit co
                    unt, then reduce the unit count only. For example.  we rececive 10 units at 500 then ship 4,800. 
                    The on hand of 5000 - 4800 = 200.  200 is less than 500 so this would simple update the unit coun
                    t.
O-T-1-   03020408 E Trailer Field on Release Ticket

                    y and they import perfectly.  Then select another bin that has 5000 quantity and the new bin chan
                    ges one of the bins that I had already selected. Current logic when I select 3 bins will only imp
                    ort the bin that will fullfill the release quantity. The client may want to pull other bins first
                    .
O-T-1-   12010404 E New Order Release Logic
                    Order actual release lines, Add button, then F1 on order number to to immediately trigger the cus
                    tomer part number.   Once an item or order is transferred to the release line, the quantity field
                     will be updateable.   This will update the partial unit field.  Once the select bin / tags are s
                    elected, the number of cases, case coun, partial case and cases per pallet will update the releas
                    e line quantity.  Lastly, the customer part# will be added as the right most field on the screen.
                       Alternatively, we could design the exact column sequence but this would require 2-3 more hours
                    .

                    Xprint form, need an option to print the customer part # under the FG item number.
                    What ever would be easier, to create a new form for them, or modify the screen with the option to

                    ot working.  See Order 1467.  If I try to delete the last item, which is bad, the program prompts
                     to delete the entire order.  The original mod required deleting an item from a tandem order. I w
                    ant this to work from order entry.  This will delete the item only from the estimate on the order
                     and rebuild the order cost.  This will combine the logic of deleting item from estimate and the 
                    ADD button in order lines with YES to rebuild the job standard.

                    When we create an order and the automatic Po window appears, the least expensive vendor is listed
                     first, down to the most expensive. Would it be possible to apply the mill sheet size restriction
                     logic from the estimate vendor selection module - to the po module? We have 4 different sheet ve
                    ndors with all different min amd max sheets sizes and my purchaser is instructed to buy on price,
                     but does not know if the sheet can be ran by the vendor due to size restrictions
O-U-1-   07090405 E Releases are not updating the Release Code immediately.

                     = Package,  SET = Set, DOZ = Dozen, BDL = Bundle.   The consumption unit of measure will remain 
                    as either EA or M.   The new sell price unit of measures will calculate exactly as the EA unit of
                     measure.  An F1 lookup will be add to finished goods item, order entry, invoicing and the price 
                    matrix.   All order entry and inventory reports must support the new unit of measures.

                    h an estimate number. They need the ability to print more than one copy of the factory ticket, or
                     have the number of copies to print preset in the system.  When the factory ticket prints right n
                    ow, the system prints all the first pages, then all the second pages.  They need it to print the 
                    first copy of the factory ticket complete, and then print the next copy, and so on. The system wi
                    ll prompt for printer information for each user the first time they run this report.  After the j

                    Travis and I have been working together on this project this morning and it isn't yet functioning
                    .
                    First, ASI should be aware that there is a T:\RCODE folder which is a test environment, and this 
                    is where we are trying to get this to work.  I suggest that nothing be installed into the Q:\RCOD
                    E production folder until we are sure we have the right combination of stuff and that it all work

Hot Keys Task#    T Overview
-------- -------- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    s. Our current test is to print an invoice through the AR screens, and see if it generates EDI.  
                    Right now it does not.  Travis ran my wk/arinvdriver.p program which tests this and that one DOES
                     work.  This indicates that everything from the "hook" on down is functioning, but that either th
                    e new edi/ed/asi/o810hook.i is not in Travis' print program, OR the system is not configured to e
                    xecute the correct program.  When in the interactive portion of the AR invoicing program, Travis 
                    hit a key to see what program he was in, and it didn't appear that he is in the Sonoco specific v
                    ersion.  Perhaps you have a generic interactive portion which then calls the ar/rep/(sonoco-versi

O-U-1-   10140407 E Add Item to Tandem Order to Show all items from Master Estimate
                    See our order 1837, which was added via the ADD TANDEM button from estimate 2445.    After existi
                    ng the order and return to Item folder, then press the Add item and answer NO to rebuild the Comb
                    o order.   This shows a list of items from the existing estimate.  
                    Show the list of items from estimate 2445 rather than estimate 1837.
O-U-1-   10190407 E Job Standards creation to AUTO COMMIT materials set as Auto Allocate
                    Currently, materials must be committed via the job file material folder.    This programming chan
                    ge will automatically committ the materials when the job standards are created via new orders, es
                    timate JobStds Button and via job file Stdcreate button.  Only REAL material with the field calle
                    d Auto Allocate is checked will automatically commit the committed quantity.   Hence the estimate
                     must have the real material code defined for cases, board, pallets, etc.     Once the job standa
                    rds are created, the quantity required known as MRP and the quantity committed are shown in the j
                    ob material file.  This committed quantity would transfer to the raw material inventory Committed
                     field and the Committed flag would change to YES. When rebuilding the job files, the program mus
                    t first decommitt materials that had been previously committed prior to building the job standard
                    s, which will again committ the materials.
O-U-1-   10280414 E Add Item.  F1 on Custome Part# must search new XRef File first.
                    Add item on order.   Enter quantity and click on CustPart#.  Press F1.  No customer part number s
                    how.       This should show the new customer part# cross reference first if it exists else show t
                    he FG item customer part#.
O-U-1-   12060403 E ADD TANDEM to only show Single and Tandem Estimates
                    Currently, the ADD TANDEM order button shows all estimate types.   This should not show Combinati
                    on or Two Piece box estimates on the estimate lookup once the Customer code is entered.
O-U-1-   12220407 E Order changes to update FG item and all estimates
                    Updating Customer Part#, Item Name, Description1, Description2, Count and Sell price must update 
                    FG Item and Estimate and Master estimate. Basically, logic when updating the FG Item file to upda
                    te all orders and estimates should be moved to the order entry screen. 
                    This will work based on N-K-1 OEFGUPT character value fields that should be updated.
O-U-1-   12310306 E History Button to add to Order
                    ADD mode will have new button called HISTORY, which will display data as the History Button.   On
                    ce the item is selected, a list of selling prices, dates and quantity would show the history.   S
                    electing a history line would add the FG item and Sell Price from that history screen directly to
                     the order line.
O-U-1-0  01260407 E New Case Label Program.
                    New case label download program.   Copy the Sharp Shooter Load tag creation program to create a u
                    nique text file called CaseLabel.TXT.   This program will not download to the new load tag file. 
                      This new text file will be used to print case labels only.   The download program will simply p
                    rompt for the case count and partial case.  The  order quantity will be divided by the case count
                     to calculate the total number of cases.    The number of cases may be changed prior to downloadi
                    ng the file.   The program will only print 1 case for the partial case.  ================
                    
O-U-1-0  03020401 E New Case Label Creation Menu
                    Create new menu called Case Label Creation.
O-U-1-0  06300406 E Touch Screen Reporting by Case
                    N-K-1 CASETAG =  This logic will be used to create case labels and load tag simultaneouly.
                    The case label progam will be modified to create / update the loadtag file. Interpack will print 
                    a bar code on the case label and they will scan the case label instead of scanning the load tag. 
                       Currently the load tag program prompt for case count and number of cases, which will remain.  
                     The number of case labels will simply be the order quantity divided by the casecount.    The Bar
                    Coded Tag Number will be the same Tag Number for Each case on the Pallet.    When receiving FG vi
                    a the Sharp Shooter Software, the program will prompt for the number of cases once the bar code i
                    s scanned. New Bar Code Logic:  We can simply have each bar code represent the case for a job as 
                    a unique bar code number.  Receipts would then allow multiple cases into multiple bin locations. 
                    Alternatively, you can have a unique bar code for all the cases on a pallet.  Each case on the pa
                    llet can have the same bar code, but we need a unique bar code for each pallet.  We cannot receiv
                    e the same bar coded tag number split into multiple bin locations.   If you just want bar coding 
                    to speed receiving and shipping without tracking inventory to the pallet level, then we will bar 
                    code all cases with the same number. Remaining logic for shipping should remain the same.
                    
O-U-1-0  09290411 E New Case field downloaded to Case Label & Load Tag Programs
                    The case label data string from ASI is missing 2 critical fields. They exist in estimate file on 
                    the Inks/Pack Folder, "Packing Code (Item Code for Mat'l Type = "C"), and Packing Note".   Once 1
                     program is changed, then we will simply copy the logic to the other program. Please note, we mus
                    t download a separate case code for each finished good item on the job, hence each form/blank ite
                    m will have a case code in the text file that is downloaded. Also, download the field called Pack
                    ing Note from the FG item file.  This field will also be added to the estimate Inks/Pack Folder. 
                     Updating in the PACK NOTE field on the estimate will update the FG item file and updating the FG
                     item file will update the estimate number defined on the FG item file. 
                    Lastly, when selecting a Case Label to print via O-U-10.   Display the Packing Code with a label 
                    "COLOR" on the Create Case Label Screen.  Once the Order number is entered, default the first FG 
                    item Code.    F1 should show FG items for that order number. When running the O-U-10 Case Label p
                    rogram, add F1 on the COLOR (Packing Note) to show a specific list of colors such as RED, BLUE, G

                    under the FG Item, the items are listed lining up at the left right under
                    the heading.  Then take a look at the Carton Size heading and the sizes do
                    not start at the very left of where that column starts.
                    3)  Remove the first "SHEET SIZE" as there are two listed right next to
                    each other.
                    4)  Remove the "BOARD PO#, VENDOR #"
                    5)  Remove "MATERIAL FOR MACHINE, SIZE, TOTAL REQUIRED"
                    6)  Department note Headings were to be BOLD & CAP and actual notes were
                    to be indented.
                    Original Sample had many of above changes???

O-U-7-   10120417 E N-K LOADTAG  Logical value to SCAN Case LABEL
                    N-K-1 LOADTAG - Special load tag print out options are available via the Character value.  SSLabe
                    l, SSBar1, etc dictate what bar code software is used to create the text file. Interger value is 
                    used to determine how many load tags to create per pallet. Logical value set to YES to scan a cas
                    e Label and bypass existing print menu.  The case label created by Century will have a bar code t
                    hat represents the FG item/job number. The format  must be X(15) 99999999 and this field should b
                    e downloaded to the text file and case label file via the O-U-10 case label program. The system w
                    ill prompt to SCAN 1 CASE LABEL  Bar code which is the FG Item#Job#.  Once the case label is scan
                    ned, the fields on the normal LOADTAG screen will be automatically populated with the job number,
                     order number and finished goods item number as beginning and ending numbers. This normal menu wi
                    ll be bypassed and then the screen will import from the case file to update the quantity per case
                     and cases per pallet and partial case.  Once SAVED, the system will download the data and the wa
                    rehouse person can print the LOAD TAG label via the Label Matrix software.   The AUTOPRINT logic 
                    of Label Matrix can automatically print the load tag. Decimal Value = 1 will generate the total l
                    oad tags required by dividing the order quantity by the pallet count. One additional tag will be 
                    created that will have a blank unit count.   When receipts are scanned via sharp shooter, the pro
                    gram will prompt for a unit count for this load tag.

Hot Keys Task#    T Overview
-------- -------- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P-R-4-   12140402 E Date Range not excluding jobs in the date range.
                    Add FROM ORDER DUE DATE to  TO ORDER DUE DATE to report.  This will show all order lines due with
                    in this range on the report.  This will work for all the materials. Problem is that jobs outside 
                    of the date range are printing on the report. Print from 10-01-2004 to 12-31-2004 and Jobs usch a
                    s 530 and 761 print that are outside the range. Also, change the screen to show PO Due Date
P-R-6-   01270405 E New selection range from GL# to GL#
                    Add new selection criteria from GL Account# to GL Account#.   This program would first search the
                     program into the existing criteria such as board, then limit the report to the range of GL accou
                    nt numbers selected.     Default from 0 to 9999999999999
P-U-1-   03220410 E Move RM Receipts Logic to ADD PO logic
                    When adding PO for corrugated set with the same material, the S/B always defaults to the first fo
                    rm for that material.  For example.  Job 1480 has 3 200B sheets.  I added PO 100081 for  Form 1 i
                    s 200 B.  When I enter 200B, the S/B defaults to 1-00.  Once I have entered the PO line for form 
                    1-0 for 200B, the next line on the PO for 200B should default to form 2.   Likewise, the [F1] loo
                    kup on the S/B should only display forms not entered on the purchase order.  This logic should be
                     similar to the raw material receipts [F1] logic recently added. See PO# 100081
P-U-1-   03220411 E ROLL uom not working for Folding "B"oard  Rolls
                    Logic that was just done for corrugated "P"aper material should work for folding "B"oard material
                     rolls.   ie when the roll width is greater than zero and material is "B"oard.   I should be able
                     to add a puchase order with ROLL as uom.  Also, I should be able to issue material via the DIA u
                    om.
P-U-1-   03220431 E + ICON in Purchase Order to act as ADD
                    Add + Icon to Purchase Order File.
P-U-1-   05250413 E F1 on Buyer Code
                    Add F1 on Buyer Code on header.
                    Add F1 on UOM on line item screen.  
                    Validation should be same a the F1 UOM lookup in the Raw Material file for raw goods.
                    Validation on  UOM for finished goods should be by sell price ( YSK: Must be EA or M).
P-U-1-   06100415 E Auto OE Purchase Order to Use Sheet Win / Max Limits
                    Purchase order to use the raw material sheet width and length restrictions to the purchasing modu
                    le, when ordering sheets. It would work exactly the way the estimating module works. I.E. Only br
                    ings in the vendor who is able to run the particular sheet size.
                    
P-U-1-   06230405 E New PO Type called "S" for Sheeting
                    New PO Type called "S" for Sheeting PO.    The PO will work as any other PO, but the PO type will
                     trigger new logic in raw material receipts and raw material issues.   Steps are as follows:
                    1)  PO for rolls such as SBS18-25 as Normal or Drop Ship to vendor.  PO 100123, 
                    2)  Raw Material Receipt for PO for Rolls.  Tag# 10012301
                    3)  PO for sheets such as real material SBS1820x30 for 10,000 EA.  PO 100122
                    4)  Raw Material Issue.   Type the PO# 100122 when creating an Issue, then enter the rolls item c
                    ode used for sheets. 
                    5)  Raw material Receipt for the new Sheets.    The cost will combine the cost of roll and cost f
                    or sheeting and freight from the 2nd PO.
P-U-1-   08030409 E COPY Button on PO Line Item Screen
                    New button called COPY on the purchasing line item screen.
P-U-1-   08100403 E New Sell Price UOM's calculated as EA for PO and FG Receipts
                    New logic and lookup will be add to purchasing and finished goods item receipts.   Add new sellin
                    g price unit of measures and descriptions:  LB - Pound, DRM - Drum, ROL = Roll, PKG = Package,  S
                    ET = Set, DOZ = Dozen, BDL = Bundle.   The consumption unit of measure will remain as either EA o
                    r M.   The new sell price unit of measures will calculate exactly as the EA unit of measure.    
P-U-1-   08180406 E Sheet Cross Grain must use Normal Grain Score Allowances
                    See PO# 100137.   The 1st item is Sheet Cross Grain and the score allowances are wrong.  They sho
                    uld be exactly like Normal Grain.     The 2nd item is Blank Cross grain and its perfect.  The 3rd
                     item in Normal cross grain and it is perfect.
P-U-1-   10280403 E Purchase Order UOM default for Order Quantity & Cost
                    See PO 100161 or add PO for FG Item SET-2325-02.   The purchase UOM defined int the FG Item item 
                    PKG should default to the Quantity UOM as the 1st line of the PO.   This now defaults to the COST
                     UOM.   The Cost UOM should transfer from the Vendor Cost Matrix UOM since this is also PKG then 
                    both UOM would default to PKG.
                    
                    Likewise, the raw material COST UOM should default the same way.
                    Do not touch the default for the Order Qty UOM for Raw Goods yet.   I will add another task.
P-U-1-   12030404 E FG Item Vend Cost by MSF for Purchasing
                    F1 on UOM in FG item VEND COST file to allow MSF.  When entering MSF on the VEND COST matrix, the
                     system must verify the TOTAL folder has Blank Width, Blank Length and Total Square Inches / Feet
                     > zeri,    When adding purchase orders for FG with vendor cost per MSF, the system must calculat
                    e the cost based on total MSF on the PO to find the correct cost on the PO.
P-U-3-   02190421 E Default Vendor form PO#
                    When the To and From PO# is the same, default the vendor code automatically.
P-U-3-   04260402 E Add logo to PO for Oracle Packaging

                    or headings.
P-U-3-   05270402 E Add Vendor Item# to POExport for Alliance Scheduling Export
                    Add new field to the purchase order export program for Alliance Scheduling.   Each line item can 
                    have a unique Vendor Item Number.  I would add to the end of the line item record.
                    This invoice will be billed to Sutherland, but paid by Freedom Corrugator.

                    HRMS will provide the ftp login on their AIX system, and they already have.  Im in control of th

P-U-3-   09230418 E Purchase Order PDF Size to Exclude Font.
                    Exclude the Logo and recreate new PDF file.
                    PDF from Century Box Format and attached to email as ASI. File is attached(CBXQuote14420.pdf at 5
                    .443 MB). I took it through Acrobat 6.0, saved out as PS and re-distilled into Acrobat with small
                    est file setting. This file is also attached(CBXQuote_Revised.pdf at 25K). I printed both documen
                    ts (I encourage you to do the same) and the text resolution looks identical. The logo does appear
                     to have lost detail.
                    I took a file from 5.4 MB to 25 K. I do not beleive this is a font issue, I think your PDF settin
                    g on output are set for high-resolution or logo is high resolution. I bet if you removed logo as 
                    a trial, the file size would drop dramatically. Maybe you have the settings for the logo to high.
                     The goal does not need to get file to 25K, but less than 1 MB would be nice. Thoughts?

                    Please see Tom's comments below.  We still need the file tweaked for RFC, but until today had not
                     gotten the feedback from HRMS.  Can you revise the export format, and retest/send?
                    If a record does not have any data, it still has to 128 bytes. This file has null records in it.

                     fully received, but we need to receive more items.     Problem is that only the 2nd item can be 
                    entered on the raw material receipt.     The PO is Open, but the 1st line item is closed.
                    We need the ability to reopen a line item to process more receipts.

                    The program will reduce the original finished goods quantity that was received with a blank tag n

S-S- -   03050409 E New Icon: Setup SS Count Tags
                    Task# 03050409.   This is a ONE TIME Icon for a new Scan Physical Count program to search the Tag
                     File.   
                    When converting from Advantzware finished goods to Sharp Shooter bar coded inventory.
                    Finished goods receipts are added in Advantzware without a corresponding tag number that is assoc
                    iated with pallet bar code tag.    Therefore, to convert to Sharp Shooter requires a program that
                     will scan the pallets with bar coded tags that will REPLACE the existing inventory that was rece
                    ived without a tag number.  This program will make that replacement. automatically.
                    For example.   Let's assume inventory was received as 100 units at 500 per unit.   First, load ta
                    gs and / or case labels with the bar coded tag number.  This must be created for the existing inv
                    entory.  Once all inventory has pallet tag numbers, then this new PHYSICAL COUNT program can be r
                    un to update the existing inventory files.   In this example,  100 tags would have been created. 
                      As each tag is scanned into the physical count, the original bin location that had a blank tag 
                    number would be deducted from inventory.
                    For safety reasons, this program eliminate the POST button at the bottom of the normal Sharp Shoo
                    ter physical count screen.    If the scanned tags has the correct warehouse / bin,  then the  use
                    r will press the Enter key to accept the existing location from the tag file.

S-S- -   06230415 E Touch Screen Reporting by Case at $100/ Hour

                     the conveyor toward the case sealer.    The case label must show:  Customer Name, Customer Item 
                    Number, Date Produced, IPI Product Number, Job Number, Case Count (number of units per case).  Fr
                    om this information we want to be able to produce the simple ProductionReport we have discussed. 
                     This Production Report will be the result of Bar Code Scanning the case label as it exits the ca
                    se sealer.  The case label will be attached to the lower left or right cornor of the case.  The s
                    canner will be fixed at the exit of the case sealer and it will be attached to a simple PC which 
                    will be on the wireless network.
                    The Production Report will need to show the following: Customer Name, Job Number, Customer Item N
                    umber, Date Produced, Shift Produced (I am not sure about how this will be done), Number of cases
                     produced.   The Production Report AUDIT TRAIL for work file must run on a cycle of 3 shifts per 
                    day and must zero itself out after each shift and at the end of each day.  
                    This report could post the the existing load tag file..  After the cases move beyond the case sea
                    ler they are then palletized.  As each pallet is completed it will be formally transfered into th

                    al count was done, the quantity would be zero. If for some reason they find the pallet / tag in s
                    tock they want to scan this and enter the correct number of units, units per pallet and / or part
                    ial count.
                    Mods:  After user deletes zero qty bin, user needs to get the tag back into bin thru physical 
                    count. F1 lookup will be only from inventory but if user enters or scans tag, posting will
                    recreate inventory for the tag if no bin exists.

                    tart and stop times plus a machine charge code.   Most likely there would be a break in the morni
                    ng and another break in the afternnoon as well as a lunch break.   Hence each break would have a 
                    start and stop time.   For example, a shift may start at 7am, Break from 9am - 9:15 am,  Lunch fr
                    om 11:00 to 11:30, break from 1:00 to 1:15 PM and Cleanup from 2:45 - 3:00 pm. When the job data
