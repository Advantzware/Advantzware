A-R-1-   09200515 E New Sort Option called Customer Since Date
                    A-R-1- sort by date.  This will help my sales reports for new customers added by date range.
                    The customer file field called Date added will be sorted with the oldest date first.

                    number range and Date range If I go into General Ledger inquiry and pull up my cash
                    account, I can get line by line detail of each customer and their payment.  This information is
                    also available if I go into General Ledger current month detail and check "detail".  However, I
                    cannot get a line by line detail of the transactions when we bill customers.  If I pull up
                    accounts receivable G/L number, I simply get the grand total billing for that day, regardless
                    of whether I've checked "detail".   I am able to get line by line detail for accounts payable to 
                    show each vendor and invoice amount.  Having this line by line detail for our billings in
                    accounts receivable would be helpful, is there any way to do this?  
A-R-1-1  05180510 E Add Past Due Aging from DOS to GUI system
                    Add Past Due Aging (J-R-B) from DOS system to GUI system
                    This report looks at the invoice date of the invoice only and changes the terms of all invoices t
                    o whatever figure is put in the past due days field.  Does not look at the terms of each individu
                    al invoice.
A-R-1-1  11010512 E Slow since now looking at factored items.
                    I believe that Yoosun added logic for FACTORED invoices which look at the finished goods file for
                     a new field called Factored Invoice.    If the toggle box is not selected, then this logic shoul
                    d not be used, hence the system should be same speed.
A-R-1-2  06130510 E New AR report called Customer Snapshot Totals
                    Creat new report to show information from the customer file maintenance, totals tab
                    ____________________________________________________

                    High balance, # invoices and average days to pay.
                    That would enable me to analyze our customer base
                    on a frequent basis.

E-C- -   08270308 E New Foam Logic based on Die Size       BILL WHEN FINISHED
                    New DB Table to define each pass.  Gross Sheet Size will remain.   The net sheet size will be rep
                    laced with multiple In and Out sheet sizes.  New fields will include the  Pass 1, Pass 2, Pass 3.
                       Each Machine Pass will include the Sheet Size Feed In Width, Length and Depth,  Sheet Out Size
                     Length, Width and Depth and Number Out Width, Lenght and Depth.  The system will calculate the d
                    ie size as the current logic works, then the system will calculate the sheet size for each drop o
                    ff sheet including the number of out on each pass.  
                    
                    For example, the blank size is 10 x 5  x 2. If we use a stocked sheet of 50 x 110 x 2.  
                    The first pass would make 2 sheets 20 x 110 x2 and 1 drop off sheet of 10 x 110 x 2.   
                    
                    The 2nd pass would cut the 20 x 110 x 2 by the die size of 20 x 10 into 11 sheets or 44 blanks(4 
                    up x11).  The 3rd pass would make the same cut or Sheet In of 20 x 110 x 2 by the die size of 20 
                    x 10 into 11 sheets.  
                    
                    The 4th pass would cut the feed in sheet size of 10 x 110  by the 10 x 20 die into 5 sheets or 20
                     blanks (4 up x 5).   This would leave a drop off sheet of 10 x10 which would be die cut by 10x 2
                    0 or 1/2 die or 2 blanks. 
                    
                    The machine routing would utilize the number out on each pass to determine the number of sheets a
                    nd hence the number of hours for each pass.
                    
E-C- -   08300513 E Machine file SU and RUN Crew Size per Square Foot
                    Machine file will have new matrix on the MR and RUN crew based on a Square Footage matrix of the 
                    machine feed type.   This would be the gross sheet for slitter or the RC department, the net shee
                    t for printer and diecutters and the blank size for finishing machines.    When estimating corrug
                    ated boxes, the crew size would transfer directly to the machine routing screen based on the squa
                    re footage of a single sheet or blank running through that machine.    The estimate will use the 
                    new crew size to calculate the cost and job standards when using the machine routing as is the ca
                    se when the estimate is calculated via the without seaching for the machine file standards.

                     the image.  When updating the Die# via the F1, only the Die# field will be updated.  If the icon
                     is used, the new image will only update the Die# if the Die# is empty.
                    Hence the DIE button will show the layout as the current logic now does.
                    This image will then print on the FIbreFC factory ticket as a separate page.
E-F- -   08020505 E Layout Machine to Prompt as Reset Inks between Flexo or Offset

                    It only copies the inks, the Packing does copy, hence we should remove the description from the p
                    opup box.  New button called Copy Pack will copy the unit information to other items within estim
                    ate, i.e. sets and tandem orders.  To accommodate this, we would need a button added for "copy pa

                    fo on all items on estimate.   Lastly, need new security button for Copy Ink and Copy Pack.
                    
                    
                    If I find estimate 2512 and item vanilla, I copy Inks.  This only copies the inks.   Many estimat

                    Cad# or Die# on the Finished goods item file will provide the same prompt for the estimate
                    defined in the item file. Once updating that item, then all blanks / forms for that estimate will
                     be

                    file is a single item or tandem estimate, then all single and tandem estimates containing that
                    FG item code should be updated. If the estimate on the FG item code is a combination
                    estimate, then the UPDATE all estimates should not appear and only the estimate on the item
                    file should be updated. Please note, CAD# would update all estimate types and should
                    update FG Item File.

                    From FG Item   to  FG Item.    From FG Category to FG Category.
                    Add Toggle boxes for  Purchased,  Manufactured, Stock Box,  Custom Box.
                    If the quote has an FG item code then the system will search the following search criteria.
                    
                    Also, add Toggle Box called Update Price Matrix.    If this is checked, this will run the logic f
                    or the button called UPDATE PRICE MATRIX found in the quote file.
                    This will only update the matrix if it exists for the customer, customer type or FG item.
                    THIS WILL NOT CREATE A NEW PRICE MATRIX.
E-G- -   11280517 E Global Price Increase not working for 6x6x6
                    Add Global price change from 6x6x6 to 6x6x6.     From  customer ATT1000 to ATT1000.  The price do
                    es not change.    Please note, the customer in the FG item file is STOCK, but the customer on the
                     quote is ATT1000.  
                    
                    If TOTAL folder has ATT1000 and 6x6x6 this will update the price.    However, I can create a quot
                    e without this field, hence if the this is not available, search the FG item customer part# if th
                    e customer is customer X.
                    
                    Change Global Price Change from FG Item to Customer Part#.
                    Also, change the Quote file from FG Item # to Customer Part#
                    
                     We need to change this entire calculation.   First, profit markup is not the same as estimating.
                       ie.  cost of $90/M   with price increase of 10% should equal $100.   This is multiplying by 1.
                    1.   This should be $90 / (1- (%/100)   or $90 / .9   Then UNDO would mutilply $100 x .9.

                    o or single item estimate, import the notes from the estimate that is selected to retrieve the da
                    ta.   F1 lookup should highlight the last estimate but whatever estimate is selected will import 
                    that estimates notes and layout.  
                    
                    Basically for Tandems.   If we enter an estimate for 2 items, you enter your first item, the note
                    s will pull in as Form 1, then when you enter your 2nd item, the notes will pull in as Form 2.  N

                    They ran this report in November and there were 978 total estimates, and 325 new)
                    If  you run this report today it only shows 312 estimates.  They run this report each month, and 
                    they average about 800-900. Solution:  If estimate has been modified, it uses the date modified. 
                     Otherwise it uses the estimated date so it is possible for the report to be different from day t
                    o day.  I understand this could be different due to modifications, but like I showed in the task,
                     they have been averaging 900 to 1000 a month for the last year, now for the last two months it i
                    s down to 300 a month.  I have no idea what has changed but something has, and they have been usi

                    In the future, it would be nice to be able to let the customer select what files to copy.

                    any chance I could get total by customer and credit
                    rating group?  No big deal if you can't, I'd be happy

                    would put me in accounts receivable heaven.

I-F-1-   07140515 E FG Bin File to Sort on each YELLOW column Heading
                    The FG Bin file needs ability to sort by different fields such as Job#,  Tag#, Warehouse, Bin, et
                    c.   Make all the column headings YELLOW so that each field may be sorted.
I-F-1-   07150504 E New Button for INVENTORY quantities
                    The order entry line item screen has buttons for On Hand,  On Order, Allocated.   The Finished Go
                    od Inventory has the column headings for the same information.   Make the column headings in the 
                    FG item file Buttons.    The Buttons should work exactly as the order entry buttons ON ORDER and 
                    ON HAND and ALLOCATED buttons.
I-F-1-   08150509 E Add ARROW buttons on Color Folder to access next FG item
                    Add ARROW buttons on the COLOR folder to work as the VIEW folder to go to next or previous FG ite

                    The bottom browser is currently a view only browser.  Add logic to allow updating the unit# which
                     will update the estimate on the browser ONLY.   
                    
                    Printing presses can have up to 10 Print stations.    Printing jobs are printed by Form / Sheet. 
                      In our system a form is designated as 1-0 or 2-0.     In this example,  4 items are on form 1. 
                      The GOTO button on the Estimate folder shows the forms and the items.    The point is that  if 
                    we load P-BLACK in unit1 on form 1, this should update all items with P-BLACK.    Bottom line, va
                    nilla item cannot have P-Black in unit 1 and chocolate item have P-Black in Unit2 and Strawberry 
                    have P-Black in Unit3.   This must be identical.    Check with Jeff on the logic that he wrote wh

I-L-1-2  07250514 E Toggle Box:  Email Direct to Customer?
                    Currently, there is no way to email the entire report when selecting all customers.    The error 
                    appears that you must select 1 customer.     This option only applies when emailing the report to
                     a specific customer.   If they want to email this report to management, then they would want to 
                    select the entire customer range.  Add toggle box called  Send to Customer?  Yes would invoke thi
                    s logic.  No would not check for the customer ranges.  When createing Email Codes for the program
                     (r-cusinv.).         Add Customer (Customer "X") and attention to Cust contacts for sending emai

I-L-1-3  04070502 E Detail Toggle Box to Print By Order#
                    Detail Toggle Box will print report by Order Number.    This must print in Landscape mode to fit 
                    two new fields.   Add cust Part# after Item Number and Add Cust PO# from the Order Line after the
                     Description.
                    
                    Please note, a finished good item could have many orders and a single order may have many custome
                    r purchase order numbers per release.   Therefore,  we can only print the purchase order number f
                    rom the line item screen.    Likewise, this report will print the item multiple times for each or
                    der whereas the summary report will print just 1 line.
I-L-6-   04250504 E FG Item truncated.   Expand and truncate another field.

                    rch for a unique tag# without entering the FG item code.  This search will first require entering
                     the FG item code followed by the tag number.   For example, to search for tag number ATT-2297   
                       00002,   the user could simple enter *02 and the tag number.
I-Q-1-   04250522 E Add Yellow Column Headers & Lock Down FG item code and new Sort by Tag

                    Whatever range of warehouses are added to the range, the total on hand will be compared to the Re
                    order Level.    For example, we have an item called 10x10x10 and we have 500 in Warehoue A, 500 i
                    n Warehouse B and 500 in Warehouse C and 500 in MAIN location with a reorder level of 1000.    If
                     I run the report for all warehouses, the item will not show on the reorder advise report because
                     2000 on hand is greater than 1000.    If we ran this report for just MAIN then the quantity of 5
                    00 is less than 1000 and the item would be on the reorder advise report.   Default the new fields

I-U-1-   09010507 E FG Assembled Sets Receipts as Unassembled
                    New Estimating and Finished goods flag called Assembled (w/Part Receipts).    This would provide 
                    3 set methods known as Assembled Sets (herin AS) , Unassembled Setsherin US and Assembled Sets (w
                    /Part Receipts) herein ASP.  Current logic for AS and UA would remain whereby FG set receipts for
                     AS will require component part receipts posted then the set receipt which would reduce the parts
                     inventory and increase the set inventory.  Whereas US receipts will populate the component parts
                     and increase both the set and parts on hand inventory.
                    
                    The new ASP receipts will simply require adding the SET receipt and the system will create the co
                    mponent receipts exactly as the US receipts.    When the FG receipt is posted, the ASP set invent
                    ory will be increased and the components will be simultaneously increased and then decreased by t
                    he set quantity times each items qty/set.   Please note, the receipts screen may be updated prior
                     to posting to increase the receipt quantity of each component based on actual production data.
                    
                    Finally, the bill of lading will reduce only ASP and AS quantity on hand wherease shipments for U
                    S will reduce both the set and the component inventory.

                    LLITEMS, which will create a single invoice for all items for the same order together on one invo

                    would calculate the Standard Cost based on the Actual Quantity Produced just as the Job Summary R

                    he Factory Cost.  Example:  I opened order number 10750 and seen the cost to be $5857.61/m which 
                    was the same as the estimate.  I then went in to the estimate number 8511 and added a misc. cost 
                    of $650/m to sheet number 1 and then recalced the estimate. This changed the cost in the estimate
                     to $6637.61/m.   I then went to the JU view job screen and clicked on recalc costs after this 
                    was complete I returned to the order and checked the cost showing and it was still $5857.61/m.  P

J-U-1-   04260510 E COPY button in Job material file to Prompt by Form/Blank#
                    Copy button currently adds a new item.     Add popup similar to estimate copy logic in the Layout
                     folder.    This will allow copy of the material to and from Form and Blank Number.
                    This will allow selecting a specifc roll size or ink or case, then copy that to all forms and bla

J-U-1-   05060517 E COPY button to copy all items, qty, materials and routing and prep.
                    Job File Copy.    This should copy all data.   First this would increment the job number by 1 on 
                    the -00 number.   This would copy the items, quantity, order number, materials, routing and prep.
J-U-1-   05060518 E Order Header Date Change to Prompt for All items.
                    When changing the order header due date, the system should prompt to change all line items?   Thi
                    s should only prompt when more than 1 item exists on the order.    When answering YES, this would
                     update both the line item due date as well as the items first release due date.
J-U-1-   05090505 E Add DB field called Run Qty to Job File Routing for each machine
                    The database has a field for sheets or blanks required for each machine.   Add this field to the

                    culate a new Run Speed from the existing Run Qty.   Likewise, if the user changes the Run Speed, 
                    recalculate the Run Hours from the existing Run Quantity.   Lastly,  Changing the Run Qty will ch

J-U-1-   07280514 E Notes in Job file
                    Right now the system assigns a record key to the notes when an estimate is established.  
                    Fibre would like the notes to get assign a new record key when the job is closed.  This would fre
                    eze the notes that are in the system at that time, and not allow them to be updated when the esti
                    mate or next job gets added.  This would also change the record key in the order, so that when lo
                    oking at order inquiry or at notes on a closed job you would see the notes that were applicable t
                    o that job only.

                    s should only prompt when more than 1 item exists on the order.    When answering YES, this would
                     update both the line item due date as well as the items first release due date.
                    
                    "Century refused to pay for mod on task# 05060518, therefore, comment out the logic for prompting
                     to change all dates."
J-U-1-   09230507 E Add Order# to Job should add Job# to Order Line
                    I am not sure of the ramifications, but I believe that when we add an order number to a job such 
                    as job W5103 then this job# should be written to the job number on the order line.
                    I know that stock box jobs may have a much larger job  quantity on the job then the order quantit
                    y on the order.    Therefore, we would need to disconnect the job standards recalculation on the 
                    order line for this type of order.    Perphaps any job starting with a letter, which would be sto
                    ck box jobs.
                    
                    
                    Once this logic is done, then the new FG Item folder would find the job number.     
J-U-1-   09300504 E Job Standards option to eliminate Updating the Routing
                    Updating the Job Standards is overriding the dates in the machine routing that has been set by th
                    e scheduler.     We need SMARTS to know when to update the labor or more specificallly to NOT upd
                    ate the machine routing when the routing has been scheduled.   The start dates and times are the 
                    critical issues.
                    
                    should have popup to update Materials or Labor.
                    If the user simply update the inks in estimating, they have to rebuild the job to move the inks.
J-U-1-   10240506 E Fountain Pen Missing
                    Add Fountain Pen to Job File.   This is the same file as estimating, however we did work for note
                    s to only show job notes.   In any event, the fountain pen should be there.
J-U-1-   11290511 E Job Standards Updating the Routing (Old Task# 09300504)
                    Updating the Job Standards is overriding the dates in the machine routing that has been set by th
                    e scheduler.     We need SMARTS to know when to update the labor or more specificallly to update 
                    the machine routing when the routing has been scheduled but import the existing machine times and
                     dates.
                    
                    Bottom line. We should always rebuild machine standards, but import the scheduled dates.
M-C-2-   12070519 E Raw Materials Cycle Count to Create Warehouse/Bin
                    Raw Material cycle count to automatically create warehouse/bin/tag.
                    The reality is that the product was moved from its original receipt, but the warehouse clerk did 
                    not transfer the goods.  Obviously, if we use a TAG#, the cost should transfer with that tag#.
                    
                    Perhaps the best logic would be a PROMPT.   Bin location does not exist, which BIN/TAG was transf
                    erred to this new location?    This should show a list of existing Warehouse/Bins, then we could 
                    transfer the cost.
M-F-1-   06200518 E New Folder called HISTORY identical to Finished Goods folder
                    Finished Goods file maintenance has a folder called HISTORY that views all transactions for that 
                    item.    Add new folder with same name in the raw materials file maintenance to view all inventor

                    Likewise, cycle count posing and RM warehouse posting will update the bin file, hence must update
                     the loadtag file.

                    he raw material tag number will be a combination of the PO#, Line# on PO and 5 digit sequencial n
                    umber.
                    From the Purchase order and line item, we will know the raw material item code, job number,  quan

                       4 decimals to .1063.    When I update the receipt under M-U-1 or Sharp Shooter, the system cal
                    culates the cost as .10625.    Therefore, round up to 5 decimals not 4.
M-U-8-   06060509 E Create RM Tags should not save settings
                    Eliminate Green bar from saving previous settings.   When I add  PO# 100300 on the first field,  
                    the parameters should transfer to the screen before displaying the loadtag creation screen.
                    On my laptop, I enter PO 249 and I get the error No w-PO Record is available.   It seems that the
                     parameters are not saved.
                    
                    Also, when creating the RM receipts via LoadTag creation, the S/B number is 0-1 on the receipt sc
                    reen, which can not be edited.   Since there is NO JOB# on the PO, the receipt line should defaul
                    t to 0-0 as it does when manually adding a receipt.   The S/B would only be required for jobs.   
M-U-8-   07250517 E Reprint Toggle Button on loadtag screen for RM loadtags
                    Simply click the Reprint toggle box at box, enter an existing tag and click OK.

                    This will work with task 11040501.
                    New logic for M-U-8 to allow receiving PO with Form# = ? for tandem jobs.
                    Add loadtag for PO# 100405.   This now imports all lines which is unfriendly to user which is not
                     accurate.  The problem is the one roll may actually be used for 3 PO Lines.    ie.   Each PO lin
                    e may only use .25 of a roll.   Ideally, they want to enter just the item and how many tags and h
                    ave the Receipt created automatically.   
N- - -   03300506 E New EMAIL Codes File
                    New Email Distribution List Codes File.     Add under top menu called CODES a new menu called Ema
                    il Codes.   The screen heading will display Email Distribution Code.
                    This will eventually replace the existing TITLE CODES used for emailing quotes, hot clients, rele
                    ases and general email.    ie.  the existing codes would be 
                    ERELEASE, EHOTS, EMAIL, EQUOTE.    We will also Add  EPurchase Order, EAcknowledgment,  EInvoice,
                      More Reports will be added as needed.
                    
                    Therefore, a single contact such as Joe Hentz with  title of President and email of Joe@Advantzwa
                    re.com will have as many email services as defined.
                    
                    Please note, the new Email Code file will allow defining a distribution list by Company, Contact 
                    and Title.    Hence, when emailing a quote to  IBM1000, only contacts for the customer IBM1000 wi
                    th the title of EQUOTE would be emailed the quote.

                    order lines or release folder will check for on hand inventory for the item / s released.   If a 
                    previous order exists with an inventory balance, the system will prompt 
                    " On hand balance exists for older order ( Show Order#'s) , Continue with Release?"    NO will be
                     the default so the that the customer service rep will cancel this release and process the origin
                    al release.  When the integer value is 0 or no, then the system will simply create the release wi

                    This is ONLY for Order for Folding Carton COMBINATION estimates.
                    
                    Delete button on Line Items should not prompt for password for Tandem estimates.   Only combinati

                    G receipts via Advantzware, Touch Screen, Sharp Shooter or Load Tag Creation.
                    
                    The character value will default to AUTOPOST which is the current logic for creating FG receipts 
                    which is dictated by the N-K-1 AUTOPOST character value.
                    
                    If the character value is not equal to AUTOPOST then the character value entered will be a combin
                    ation of the 5 character warehouse and the 8 character bin location.   Therefore, if the default 
                    location is MAIN and FLOOR is the default bin location, then the user must enter the space so the
                     character value will read MAIN FLOOR.    
                    
                    The first 5 characters must exist in the warehouse file and the next 8 characters must exist in t

                    Original task:
                    Display warning message when adding purchase orders when the cost of the material in the job file
                     is less than the cost of the material on the purchase order for a specific vendor matrix.
                    Therefore, if the estimate was generated with a certain vendor and a different vendor were select
                    ed with a higher cost, the message would display. 
                    "VENDOR COST IS HIGHER THEN ESTIMATED",    CONTINUE  YES,   Yes would allow adding the  cost.   T
                    he system is not allowing them to say yes when the board is a higher cost.
N-K-1-   02140515 E N-K ADDRELAS character value Bins/Tag via O-U-1 Release
                    When creating actual release it will bring up the select bins browser seen in O-T-1. This will al
                    low you to ID actual pallets to ship. Pallets you select will have a check mark next to on the re
                    lease ticket. Warehouse people should go to those pallets when shipping. If there is no pallets i
                    n warehouse, just close browser.
                    Mod is not completed, here is additional requested changes:
                    1. No prompt necessary.   Show Select Bins / Tags Only when Tags on Hand Exist.  Hence, just crea
                    te Actual Release as normal program works.
                    2. The mod is not updating release quantity if you select bins greater than what was released. 
                    3. If quantity is greater than actual release, prompt CSR "Selected tag quantity is greater than 
                    release update release?" default is yes.
                    4. I did not test this aspect but, here is thought:. I release 10,000 and choose select bins and 
                    tags, no inventory in warehouse, we do not want to change release to zero if no pallets are selec
                    ted. Logic needs to be if no pallets in inventory, and CSR says yes to prompt "Do you want to sel
                    ect bins and tags?", it prompts, "No inventory in warehouse". Release adds to release ticket with
                     no change avoiding opening select bin browser window.

                    We got a test file from Container Services and I have several questions regarding that test file.
                     (Please see attached file for reference)
                    If the Score has no value, can you leave it blank instead of putting :00 in the file? Also, if a 
                    score is 0.06, the value in the file should be 000:06 instead of :06. 
                    In D1 (08-13) where PO number should be, can you put Container Services Production Number in tha
                    t field? 
                    Will you put Score Types (for example: D, M, R and etc) in between Scores? 
                    This may require  DB fields called Score Type for each Score on the PO.

                    llowing Issues Resolved.
                    1. Scores with ###.00 in the positions where there are no scores.  Joe and I have discussed this 
                    issue and I believe Advantzware was going to make a change so these are blank or with zeroes.  We
                     prefer the blanks as they were when the original test file was sent from Advantzware.
                    2. Add Special Instructions.  We do not see any instructions being passed in the file sent from A
                    dvantzware.  On page 1 of the attached you will see an order asking for "male to male scores" in 
                    the instructions.  On Page 2 is the actual data sent of this order.  No where in this file does t
                    he instruction "male to male scores" appear.  Yet, the HRMS format supports a location for "speci
                    al instructions" (as shown on page 3).   We will need the instruction field that coordinates with
                     the field seen on the PO printout.  The ideal place to put it will be the D5 location in the HRM
                    S format labeled "Special Instructions".
                    3) Clearly out side the realm of the HRMS format.  They need the job number that appears on your 
                    fax printout.  We would like to add it and you can add this to our bill.  There should be a place
                     where we can add this with in the file format of HRMS.  This may be best to let your programmer 
                    and my programmer (Wei) decide.  Is this doable?
                    4)  Add Score Types to File and Download to PO Export.

                    See Emails 1 file can only contain 1 set of header records. The detail records can repeat any num
                    ber of times for additional orders sent in this batch. The header records can not repeat in a sin
                    gle file. Use the naming structure given which has a time stamp built into the file name so each 
                    is unique, if your system must put header and detail records together. The scoring now has the ma
                    sk writing to the file in stead of the formatted result. I will continue to look at this to check
                     in more detail.

                    In order to make this idea work (i.e.  to replace the time-clock) we will
                    have to make sure that the system can accommodate the parameters that we use
                    to regulate time and overtime worked.  e.g. Minutes of "grace" for late clock-ins; overtime paid 
                    in 15-minute increments; not getting paid for clocking-in before the official shift
                    start-time; rules for calculating time &  and double-time; etc.

                    This logic may be used to hold a group of bill of ladings for a clients so that the bill of ladin

                     means that the  board material is a roll and there is no sheet length.
                    Example, print PO# 100335.  Length should not print for estimate material when ROLL field = YES o
                    n layout folder for each from.   If real material, if roll width > 0 then lenght should not print

                    ds of ink to right ink name.    Ink numbers need to print based on number of inks.
                    Unipak may have 2 or 3 ink passes hence a fixed INK 1 - 8 is not printing when the Unit 1 is repe
                    ated.   Hence Unit 1-6  may have a different ink code for each pass.    Print the Unit # to match
                     the number entered as the database field.   Hence we could have Unit 1 repeat 2-3 times.   Sort

                    y want each job totaled separately.    For example, if a job required 3 forms of SBS18 for 2 jobs
                     now print total of 25,000 sheets.   
                    Print 12,500 for each job.

                    When N-K-1 FGRECPT = TSPARTS.    Since sets must be received via Advantzware, hence the job will 
                    be closed via Advantzware for sets.   When posting data from the touch screen when last operation
                     is manually changed to Complete, then system should prompt to CLOSE the job regardless of the ov
                    errun / underrun percentage.  This will only complete the jobs for sets when all components are c
                    omplete and the final assembly operation is complete.  Please note, closing jobs via FG Post crea
                    tes auto issue for materials based on quantity produced.   Therefore, closing jobs via TS must us
                    e the quantity produced via TS to auto issue materials.

N-K-1-   08040508 E N-K AddPrep?  Prompt to Update Prep File for Die# or Plate#
                    Current logic requires the Die# and Plate#  to be added to the PREP file then added to the SPEC f
                    older in estimating.      If the logical value is YES, then the system will search the Prep file 
                    when a Die# or Plate# is added to the spec folder.   If the new numbers do not exist in the prep 
                    file, then the system will prompt the following message.   Die# or Plate# does not exist,  Update
                     Prep File?    YES will then create the record in the prep file and display  the file for updatin
                    g.   The program will automatically download all the current estimating information such as custo
                    mer code, estimate number number up,  style, lenght, width, depth, etc.     The owner information
                     will default to customer X  as 100%.  Information such as Category, Cost, Account#, Bin Location
                    , etc. that is not contained in the estimate will transfer from the first prep material by prep m
                    aterial type.    For example, the Plate GL Account # will default from the the first estimated Pr
                    ep Plate.  Likewise, the Die GL Account # will default from the first Die material.     Once the 
                    data is downloaded the new prep code will be in UPDATE mode so that the planner / estimator may m
                    ake any changes before saving the data.    Once saved, the system will return to the die# field. 
                     Logic will be added to both folding and corrugated spec folders for Die# and Plate#.

N-K-1-   09130508 E N-K JobCardF = CentBox The SPC# Century Jobcard to print the bar code
                    When N-K-JobcardF = CentBox, the SPC# is created.  Add logic to create SPC#.   Currently the Cent
                    ury SPC# is a created during order entry as the Job# and the Blank#.   This becomes the bar code 
                    number at the top of the form.   Change the logic for each item to equal the job# and form#  and 
                    Blank# for the SPC#.   Howewer, the Bar Code number will only be the Job Number and Form#.   Also
                    , change the SPC/ QC number to be the Job# and Form#.  Therefore, 3 items on the same sheet / die
                     will have identical SPC/QC numbers.
                    For example if job number is 123456-99 with two blanks on form 1 and two items on form 2.
                    The SPC# will be 123456-99-01-01, 123456-99-01-02,  123456-99-02-01and 123456-99-02-02.
                    The bar code will be 123456-99-01 and 123456-99-02.
                    Please note, the QC/SPC# is now maximized at 15 characters and will not print the entire code on

N-K-1-   09220509 E N-K FGRECPT called AUTOPOST Unassembled Sets
                    When N-K-1 FGRECPT character value is set to AUTOPOST, TSPOSTFG or TSPARTS the assumption is that
                     the components are received via data collection.    When adding the unassembled set receipt, the
                     system currently imports all the components.   Obviously, this is redundant since the components
                     have been received via data collection.    Therefore, when receiving the set header for an unass
                    embled set, the same popup will display as for assembled sets.   The system will check the on han
                    d balances of each component to deterermine how many sets can be produced.    The one exception i
                    s the system must reduce the component inventory by the set on hand balance for this JOB# since t
                    his is a redundated quantity.
                    
                    For example, if the set include 1 RSC, 3 width partitions and 5 length partitions and we currentl
                    y have 100 sets on hand then the program will substract 100 RSC, 300 PartW and 500 PartL for the 
                    existing components on hand balances.    Hence if we had 1000 RSC,  3000 PartW and 5000 PartL and
                     we tried to enter 1000 SETS,  the POP UP would provide the warning that the Receipt cannot be pr
                    oduced,  Correct the Receipt Quantity.
                    The correct Set Receipt would be 900 sets.     1000 RSC's minus 100 Sets Onhand x Qty/Set

                    When Logical Value is YES, adding a machines production and waste totals via Touch Screen Data Co
                    llection, the total quantity entered must be validated against the previous machines total quanti
                    ty produced.    If the data collection plant person enters a total that exceeds the prior machine
                    , then prompt,  QUANTITY / WASTE EXCEEDS PRIOR MACHINE,   PRESS IGNORE or CORRECT.   Correct will
                     place the cursor back to the quantity field.   The touch screen must validate all posted quantit
                    es and current data collection to validate the totals.    
                    
                    Please note, this logic must validate by form number and must use the number out and number up.  
                     For example, if we slit 1000 sheets 50 x 100 into 50x50 and we print and die cut a 2 up die, the
                    n we will glue 4000 blanks.     If a job is started on Monday and 500 sheets are slit then posted
                    , then Tuesday another 500 sheets are slit and 50 sheets wasted, but not posted, the Printer must
                     verify that a total of ONLY good 2000 sheets (2x1000) can be entered for the printer for both pr
                    oduced and waste.    Therefore, if the plant enters 1950 produced and 150 waste on the printer, a
                     message would appear "Production/Waste of 2200 exceeds 2000 via Prior Operation.    Likewise, if
                     the diecutter produces  2000 good sheets, then the glue can only produce a total of 4000 blanks 
                    including waste.  2000 x 2 up on the die.

N-K-1-   12080401 E N-K TSPOSTFG  Create Set Header Receipts via Touch Screen?
                    TSPOSTFG - Is Logic to create SET Header Receipts via Touch Screen.  
                    Touch screen plant data collection will prompt for units and unit count, bin location and warehou
                    se to post immediately to the finished goods receipts. 
                    LOGICAL value is YES, this logic will be invoked, hence the N-K-1 FGRECEIPT character value shoul
                    d be set to TSPOSTFG.   Unit count for each part and set will prompt.
                    Please note, the finished goods receipt will be created when each form is completed regardless wh
                    ether the set is Assembled or Unassembled. Each form that completes the production RUN will post 
                    to the FG receipt for that component only.
                    
                    Integer Value of 1 will automatically create Set Header Receipts for the machine operation define
                    d in the character value.  The set header item code is defined on the estimate via the SET button
                    , which is then transferred to the order enter system as well as the finished goods file.  When N
                    -K-FGRECPT is TSPOST, then Touch Screen creates the finished goods receipts for all the component
                    s when the last operation production quantity is posted for each part / form.   When the very las
                    t form has an operation that will ASSEMBLE the set components, this new logic will create a finis
                    hed goods receipt for the Set Header FG item code.    We will assume the machine code is ASSEM1 o
                    r ASSEM2 or ASSEM3 or otherwise defined in the character value.  The net result will be the last 
                    two machine codes on the last part / form will both produce finished goods receipts for the compo
                    nent and then the set header item.
N-K-1-   12080402 E N-K JobCardC = PREMIER to have last page a SET HEADER item info

                     additional page after the last form that will print the Set Header information similar to the SE
                    T MAINTENACE screen will all the components and QTY/SET required.   
                    In addition the machine code on the job that matches the machine code defined on the N-K-1 TSPOST
                    FG character value will print the machine data onto the last page of the job ticket from the last
                     form in the job routing screen.  
                    No Scoring allowances will print for this set page.

Hot Keys Task#    T Overview
-------- -------- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Jeff  If order entry takes under 3 hours, add more logic below from Task 12160403. 
                    N-K-FGPart#  to make the customer part number unique all all FG items throughout the entire syste
                    m.
                    LOGICAL VALUE = YES.  During order entry when a finished good item is created,  the customer part
                     number unique.   i.e.  only 1 customer part number for 1 finished goods item code.   Please note
                    , the N-Q-3 merging FG items will not use this logic since it will be assumed that all items are 
                    unique prior to merging.
                    LOGICAL VALUE = NO,   Logic will allow the same customer part# for different customers, hence man
                    y customers may call a box 8x8x8, but the FG item code may be unique.
                    Add logic every where that a finished good item is created to make the customer part number uniqu
                    e.   i.e.  only 1 customer part number for 1 finished goods item code.  The following programs mu

                    Please note, the N-Q-3 merging FG items will not use this logic since it will be assumed that all
                     items are unique prior to merging.
N-K-1-   12280401 E N-K JobcardF = CentBox to print JPG Die Design
                    In the estimate module you allow the import of a box design by entering the Die# on the SPEC fold
                    er.  Advantzware will import the JPG die drawing from the N-K-1DIEFILE directory. 
                    Therefore, Century must save DieImages as .JPG files to this directory.  The image will be stored
                     on the box design image screen, hence may be updated on the screen.
                    When printig century factory ticket, O-U-5, this cad image will print as a 2nd page. 
                    The first Die# on the form will print.
N-K-1-   12280402 E N-K RELMERGE  O-T-1 to match job lines to orders.
                    RELMERGE integer value to prevent O-T-1 from allowing multiple job numbers or job numbers that ar
                    e different than the job number on the order.  SS Receipts to a job/order should equal shipments/
                    bol to job/order.  If a load tag is scanned to create BOL but that exact order is not on release(
                    i.e. same fg but different order) it should revert to the logic on mod task number 11030410. Even
                     if is same fg number but different order/job, it should add to release for scanned order and del
                    ete from release on original released order.
                    INTEGER VALUE:  1 will allow job numbers that are not for the existing orders job number.   A 0 w
                    ill not allow a job number that does not exist the order to be added to the actual release via th
                    e O-T-1 keys.   This will only apply to orders with an estimate and job number.   For example,  i
                    f an order that was created from an estimate has a job number 600-00, then only inventory receive
                    d to that item may be added to the actual release lines via O-T-1.
                    -S-1 will not allowing multiple job numbers or job numbers that are different than the job number
                     on the order when the character value is CENTBOX.

                    r on the order when the character value is CENTBOX.
                    Please note, O-U-1 creating Release will also only move jobs associated with that order/job# to t
                    he release lines.  As we discussed, we do not want system to allow us to ship off of other job or
                     order. This is big concern. Receipts to a job/order should equal shipments/bol to job/order.  If
                     a load tag is scanned to create BOL but that exact order is not on release(i.e. same fg but diff
                    erent order) it should revert to the logic on mod task number 11030410. Even if is same fg number
                     but different order/job, it should add to release for scanned order and delete from release on o
                    riginal released order.

                    This will work similar to a find and replace utility.  You will be able to specify the characters

                    is point the only task left is getting the EDI "hooks" into the invoice printing program like we 
                    did last year on the old system.  Please send me a quote on the cost of doing this and I will sig
                    n and return.

O-B-5-   09200521 E AR and OE Invoice to Download File to CIT for Only Factored FG Items
                    Add new Reftable DB Yes / No field on the FG item Totals File called Factor Invoice.
                    Only items that are checked will be downloaded to the CIT batch file when the invoice is posting 
                    and the Download to CIT box is checked.   Currently, the invoice posting program requires a field
                     called Download to CIT.  This new logic will automatically create the file for items checked as 
                    factorred.   Please note, this logic is only for OE invoice since the AR invoice does not have an
                     FG item code.  Add check box for  Factored item only ? If yes, do only for factored item or any 
                    invoice has at least one factored item.
                    
                    New check box in the FG item file for each FG item called Factor Invoice?.  When posting invoices
                     the Box called Export to CIT must be CHECKED .  This will create a file for factored items only.
                      This will create a file for ONLY the finished goods items that are checked.   
                    
                    Also, add toggle box on AR Aging report called Include Factored FG Items ?  Yes will be the curre
                    nt logic.    Unchecked, will then create an AR aging for only invoices with non factored items.  
                    ie. invoiced items that must be collected by Frankston.    Factored invoices for factored items w
                    ill be collected by the Collection Agency / Bank.  Please note, when an invoice has both factored
                     and non factored items,  the arging will include that invoice.  
                    
                    
                    
O-B-5-   12060514 E Invoice Post to post Invoice Line#
                    Invoice to post the sequential line number as the invoice is printed.   This would have no relati
                    on to the order line number or the manually entered line number on the order.
                    If multiple orders were on an invoice, every single order may be line 1.
                    Therefore the line number sequence as the invoice printed should be posted to the invoice history
                     so that AR reprint will reprint the same sort option.

                    ne warehouse, the quantity on hand for this report will include just the warehouses selected.
                    
                    My goal is to have the On-hand column of the scheduled release report warehouse specific warehous
                    e when needed.  For our Stock box program, we have inventory in both the San Antonio (ASW) wareho
                    use and the Kaufman (175) warehouse.  The trouble is that when we print the scheduled release rep
                    ort, we can not be certain what quantity is in our warehouse without further investigation or cro
                    ss-referencing.  See the example below.  Stock1-01 carton is in both warehouses and the On-hand i
                    s a cumulative 42m but we may have 0 in Kaufman and all of it could be in SA.

                    Is there any way we can add a sort option by credit rating
                    on the scheduled release reports (?)  O-R-2, that would

                    Customer will be Cash on Delivery (COD) when the orders payment terms are defined as COD.   Since
                     the customer payment terms file only has two fields called terms code and description, we will a
                    dd a new field in the terms file called COD.  Therefore, the program will check the orders paymen
                    t terms then search the COD field.   If yes, then the total invoice amount will be entered on the

                    r entry, then creating bill of lading directly via order enter or via release posting,   the syst
                    em should leave the tag number blank. This is used for customer returns, hence the tag numbers ar
                    e unknown. For example,  we ship 10 units at 1000 per pallet with tag numbered 1 to 10. Two units
                     are returned by creating a negative release for 2000, which creates a bill of lading for -2 unit
                    s at 1000 per unit with NO TAG Number. This in turn creates a negative invoice, thus updating the
                     inventory with 2000 on hand without a tag number.

                    tem. Every few days I have to go and delete these release tickets from O-T-1. We would like this 
                    aspect to be stopped. If item is not scanned it should be deleted from release ticket and left as
                     a scheduled release within O-U-1. Here is example:
                    
O-U-1-   01110503 E Add Tandem logic to always stop for order line entry

O-U-1-   03020503 E Assembled Sets Unit Count to default from New Set Packing screen.
                    Assemble sets require information on how to pack the set. Currently, we use the first part and pr
                    ompt to copy to all components.  In reality, each component must be packed on a pallet for days o
                    r weeks until the final assembly is finished. Additional tasks will be written for the following:
                     Therefore we need separate packing information for the set header as well as the components.  Th
                    e set header information will be used for printing the Premier Job Ticket for the set header pack
                    ing information and also for FG receipts via touch screen and Advantzware.   Likewise the Set pac
                    king unit count should transfer to order entry.

O-U-1-   03160504 E Order Release to Update UnPrinted Releases 1st Then Printed Releases
                    When creating releases via order entry or order inquiry,  the system searches for UNPRINTED relea
                    ses for the same customer and shipto and date.   If available, the program should prompt to add n
                    ew release to existing release. If no UNPRINTED releases are available, this should also search P
                    RINTED releases in O-T-1.   Once added to this release, the printed flag is changed to UNPRINTED.
                     This logic will be triggered when N-K-1 RELMERGE logical value is YES. Original MOD Task 1116040
                    7 did not prioritize UNPRINTED status. Just add if Unprinted update Unprinted release rather than

                    e (view order tab) it should prompt to udpate the order header due date.   Also, if line item dat
                    e (items tab) is changed before the header due date (view order tab) it asks to update due date.

                     Hand > zero, then the row will be colored bronzed.  If the item is stocked and the on hand quant
                    ity is  < 0 then this will show as the color of marroon.
O-U-1-   05200511 E Add Line Item, Click HISTORY button on item detail Screen
                    The HISTORY button on the Item Detail screen shows past sales.  For example, find order for ATT10

                    Next, click the item 12x12x12 and a list of sales appear.    Once an item and quantity are select
                    ed, the quantity and price will import into the order line screen.    The system should FIRST sea
                    rch the Price Matrix under O-F-3 for a price.    The same logic must be used as adding an item wi
                    thout selecting the HISTORY button to find the price from the price matrix. 
                    That is find price by customer,  then customer type , then item based on the quantity.
                    If a price does not exist for an item in the price matrix,  PROMPT,  No price exists in the price
                     matrix,  Import Sell Price from History.    YES will then import the price from the sales histor

                    "Order Qty differs from Release Quantites,  click Release Tab to Update"
                    If the user clicks NO, then the release quantity will not be updated.
O-U-1-   06010514 E Delete Last Item but Add MISC.  Order is deleted.
                    Can an order exist without a FG item?   They add MISC items without an FG  ITEM, however if the F
                    G Item is deleted the order is erased.  I suspect the MISC item becomes a phathom item?  We added
                     logic to keep order, but that created FG item as 0.

                     allocated for this component via order entry would continue to be updated in the finished goods 
                    file.    When this field is Purchased then the finished goods item created for this set component
                     would not update the quantity on order in the finished goods file for that item or component.   
                    Once a purchase order is created for this set component item, then the on order quantity would be
                     updated.  Likewise, FG receipts for the set item should not update the on hand or reduce the on

O-U-1-   08150513 E FG item file, Color Folder to Update the Estimates
                    First, when creating FG items via estimating or order processing, the estimate inks should be dow
                    nloaded to the FG Color Folder.   If the estimate has INK 5 times and Varnish 1 time, the Colors 
                    should relex the same.   Currently, only 1 ink is downloaded to the color folder.  When the estim
                    ate is updated then the estimate shows just 1 ink, but indicated 5 colors, 1 coating.
                    
                    When adding, changing or updating the inks in the COLOR folder in the finished good file the syst
                    em should prompt to update the estimates?    Please note, this will update the inks based on the 
                    PRESS type on the machine routing only.    Hence if the item has both flexo and offset, this will

                    ls.    The job quantity must always be recalculated and always YES to decommit.
                    
O-U-1-   12090504 E Rebuilding Job Standards should use RM AUTO ALLOCATE to Commit Board
                    Whenever job standards are rebuilt, the program should look at the raw material field called AUTO
                     ALLOCATE for real material.    This would be true for board, cases, inks, etc.
                    Once the job quantity and materials standard MRP quantity are created the system would then COMMI
                    TT the MRP quantity for each real mateial.  This only has to do with committing board to a job an
                    d not ISSUES to the job.
                    
                    Please note, the job cost file maintenance fields are only used to make the flag Y in the job mat

                    similar to the Keystone factory ticket.   The fields will prompt for the starting sheet count for
                     each Form for each Job#.  Once they enter in the sheet count, this will recalc the job starting 
                    sheet count for each machine, under the machine counts on the factory ticket.  This should also w
                    rite back to the job file.   The prompt would be a follows:

                    Only the starting sheet could will be updateable.  Also,  the note section of the factory ticket 
                    now prints both the title line, and the department  description.  This is duplicate information. 
                     Only the actual body of the notes should print.

                    job.  This will need to validate the item on the job matches the item on the order.  For sets, if
                     the set header item on the job matches any one of the components on the order then pull in that 
                    information for that order.  Then  when the factory ticket prints this will print the overrun/und
                    errun% the PO#'s, the order# and the CSR name.  They do not want the job quantity to calculate ba

                    Corrugated ticket needs a few adjustment.
                    This should work just like a set when it comes to the board information and when you have
                    multiple blanks on one form.  If there are multiple blanks on one form, the first form
                    should have ths shts required and board size, and the other blanks should say see blank 1.
                    This is exactly like a set with multiple blanks per form. Also if it is a combo, the type of set
                    "A" or "U" should not be printing at the top of the page.
O-U-5-   10150405 E HOP Job Ticket to print from First Non Closed Release.

O-U-6-   01030508 E Receipts for Closed Jobs to Update Qty Produced

                     Receipt to posted after the job was closed.   Update the FG receipts so the N-F-10 rebuild bins 
                    will correct the Qty produced.
O-U-6-   01190504 E Erase Formula for On Hand Balance & Show Bin Total
                    Balance On Hand is a formula dictated by Mike.   Erase this formula and simply print the current

O-U-7-   02010512 E RETURNS Button on Load Tags
                    When Toggle called RETURNS is checked,  the Return Load tags will not create a FG receipt when N-
                    K-1 FGRECEIPT character is Loadtag. When the Retruns toggle box is NOT checked and the N-K-1 FGRE
                    CEIPT with Character value = Loadtag then FG receipts will be created.
O-U-7-   02110515 E Load Tag Toggle Button called   Returns

                    creation program will automatically create FG receipts for each loadtag created. 
                    When the new toggle box called RETURNS is checked, the FG receipts will not be created.
                    The logic is that the finished goods were already received, are now returned and we are just crea
                    ting new load tags for the reworked finished goods. HAVE THIS AUTO CHECKED with Order Qty or Rele
                    ase QTY is negative.
O-U-7-   07180519 E Download SPEC Code SN to Load Tag Text File
                    Download SPEC notes defined as SN to the load tag file.  Each line of notes in the FG file under 
                    the book icon for spec code will be downloaded.   Each line will be defined as 80 characters or w
                    hen a return key is found.    Up to 10 lines of note will be downloaded to the text file so the t
                    he user may add this note to the load tag label. 
O-U-7-   07210510 E New Radio Button PO Receipt or Job/Order Receipt

                    Order Receipt  and Purchased Item Receipt.    Current logic will be the Job/Order Receipt.   New 
                    Button call Purchase Item Receipt will change the labels from Order Number to Purchase Order Numb
                    ers.    Also, the Job# will not be updateable since the item was purchased, hence not manufacture
                    d.   When the loadtag is created, the Purchase Order Number will be updated in the LoadTag File. 
                        Hence, when scanning a sharp shooter receipt, the Purchase Order Number will be imported and

                    cimals.  
                    
                    Can you put an extra decimal in the purchase order cost field or what are our options?

                    uld be determined on the total quantity.  
                    
                    This logic would only require RM load tags based on 1 consolidated PO Line and receipts based on 
                    1 PO Line.

                    1)  Tag# changing when you tab through fields
                    2)  when you enter the tag number, I beleive this should then go directly to the quantity field
                    ( this could be programmed into the scanner itself)

T- - -   04180507 E Clock In/Out Logic Issues / Changes
                    We have now installed a "Clock P/C" and scanner to run this program.The logic and lay-out is much
                     better now, and it is working well but for a couple of minor points:
                    1   When the program first launches we get two error messages as below:
                    2    We don't want employees to be able to accidentally close the "Clock-in/out" screen.
                    Currently, if they hit the "X" in the top right-hand corner, it asks for a password to close it.
                    However, if you don't have the password, it closes anyway. This is not good.
                    3   The layout would look better if the "Clock-in/out" box could be centred on the screen instead
                     of being in the top left-hand corner. Can you please change this?
                    4   We still have to work out the mods for the TR9 report so that we get the corrected number of 
                    hours for each employee (e.g. To exclude time clocked-in before the shift commences, etc.)

T- - -   08030511 E TS to Update Schedule Board
                    I bring jobs forward after the days production ( from 27th to the 28th). All is good.  (see below
                     pic 1). When we post daily data collection jobs that are not complete from the 27th production t
                    hat have been moved to the 28th disappears from board. (see pic 2). I have been tracking this for
                     a while and now have proof. And yes the jobs that have disappeared have not been completed, I ca
                    n select them in touch screen module. Hope this helps in fixing problem.
                    
                    This isn't a schedule board issue.  It's a data collection issue.  If you were to check the job's
                     in question, you will find the job's status as "C" for closed, even though routings remain uncom
                    pleted (which makes them available to touch screen).  I'm working this issue and hope to have it 
                    resolved very soon.  I'll contact you to let you know when a fix is in place.
T- - -   08160508 E Time Clock Validation
                    Add CANCEL button on Clock In and CLock Out.
                    Prevent them from being able to press buttons out of sequence.
                    i.e.  If they push log-in then log-out, both icons remain on the screen, although one is mainly h
                    idden by the other.  It would be better if they were forced to swipe in a clock # after pressing 
                    log-in or log-out. (If somebody presses log-out by mistake instead of log-in, there still should 
                    be a way for them to back out of it.)
                    
                    Another issue is that some folks claim that although they logged-off the night before, the time-c
                    lock requires them to log-off again the next morning. (I have not yet been able to see this for m
                    yself, so it may not be valid.)

                    ely in the Job Routing file.  As soon as the operator processes a job's machine via Job Data Coll

                    essing the schedule board.  Please note, data collectioin for the first machine on the job routin
                    g will update the job header start date.

                    Copy logic from task# 07200506.   Also, jobs listed by machine should show based on the scheduled
                     machine.  When selecting machine 408, job 2267 should appear.
                    When selecting a machine 408 during Touch data collection for job 2267, the system should prompt 
                    to update the job routing because machine 408L is the machine on the routing however the correct 
                    scheduling machine is 408.    When selecting machine 408, the system should convert the data coll
                    ection to machine 408L, hence this would not update the job file.
                    
                    If the machine entered is the scheduling machine for multiple departments on the job routing scre
                    en, then the data collection must prompt, which department.   For example if the Langsston can Pr
                    int, Diecut and GL and 3 separate machines such as LANGPR, LANGDC and LANGGL are defined that all
                     point to the LANGS as the scheduled machine, then the popup would display the Departments PR, DC
                     and GL.  Once selected, the LANGS would convert into the correct machine defined on the job rout
                    ing screen. 
                    
                    When Posting the Touch Screen transactions for the 408, the hours will be posted to the actual ma

V-C-3-   12200501 E New check format = Oracle laser

                    Copy ADVLASER but change page break to work with their dell printer
V-F- -   01180207 E New Logic for Reverse Entrys
                    Create Reversing entries in enter/edit journal entries.  
                    Mark entry as a reversing entry.  When posted, a new reversing entry will be created with a date 
                    of the 1st day of the following period.
                    
                    You can also store these entries in recurring entries screen and load when needed.
V-F-1-   05090513 E Add new field to store the vendor's Tax ID#
                    Add new field on the vendor file to store the vendor's Tax ID#.  This will then print on the 1099
                     report under the vendor's name.
V-F-1-   11230519 E Vendor File Field Definitions
                    Create Output Word Document for the customer file.
                    This will be saved under K:\GUIMANUAL\FILE DEFINITIONS\Accounts Payable\
V-R-1-1  03150504 E Add description column to report
                    Add a description column to the AP Accounts by Vendor (V-R-11) report to show the description fie
                    ld entered for each line item of the AP invoice.
                    ________________________________________________________
                    When entering accounts payable invoices, on the bottom
                    half of the page, the general ledger account number
                    is entered and then there is a field for description.
                    I find this description field to be very valuable to me
                    particularly on bills that have no p.o. (freight bills,
                    odd balls, etc).  The description that I enter WILL show up when
                    I run the vendor invoices edit registers for that particular batch of payables but I cannot seem 
                    to retrieve that information in any of the accounts payable or general ledger reports once the ba
                    tch is posted.
                    
                    Can you find out if it is feasible to have the information
                    from the description field to show up on either
                    an accounts payable or general ledger report and how much it would cost?
                    Thanks, Deb
