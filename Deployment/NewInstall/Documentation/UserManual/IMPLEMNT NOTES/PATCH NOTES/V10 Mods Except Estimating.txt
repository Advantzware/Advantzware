                    culated.  The Markup Percentage will print below warehousing.
                    Hence, if warehouse percentage is 10% and Markup% is 10%, they will be same dollar value.
                    Estimate will show Factory Markup.
                    
                    This will add to FULL Cost and is used in Margin, Commision and Sell Price Calculation.

E-R-7-   06170905 E Change Report to Find Last Job# from J-U-1
                    A PREP code on an estimate may be used by many Finished Goods Items.
                    For example, PLATE may be used on many jobs.
                    The data collection module writes the LAST job number to the E-B-8 Prep file.
                    The E-R-7 report simply prints this job number.
                    This is not dynamic enough.
                    New Logic should find the last job number for the FG Item on the estimate.
                    
                    Examples of Bad Data at Fibre Follow:
                    Prep Code 4434 ? Shows last JOB 110219 (this is wrong).  It also shows last ORDER 110493 (this is
                     correct).
                    Prep Code 6919 ? Shows last JOB 98507 (this is wrong).  It also shows last ORDER 96419 (this is c
                    orrect).
                    Prep Code 7555 ? Shows last JOB 99053 (this is wrong).  It also shows last ORDER 116340 (this is 
                    correct).
                    Seems pretty consistent where the JOB # is wrong but the ORDER # is correct on these.
                    
                    
                    ASI Response:
                    Please note, the Plate or Die must exist on the SPEC folder under Plate# and/or Die#

                    history, Transaction file, etc.     On Finished Goods Cycle Count Report (IC1).  The reason for t
                    his database change is that purchased items and not produced, the cycle count report gives some d
                    ate from the far past rather than the last receipt date?  
                    Hence, IC1 should also print the receipt date by PO# if this field exists.

                    This is the item under I-F-1 that will serve for default fields when adding a new FG item.
                    The VEND COST tab has a UOM.
                    This UOM should be copied to any new FG item created.
                    
                    This works when adding new FG item without an estimate via the I-F-1 finished goods file.
                    Adding new item on the fly during order entry does not copy the Vend Cost UOM.

                    Create a new FG#, this should copy the defaults from the FGMASTER in FG file.
                    Go to the Inventory folder in FG, the purchased quantity UOM should be the same as from the

                    This Utility Converts the total quantity on hand Finished Goods into Raw Materials.
                    We need to new logic to convert specific rolls / tags.
                    For example, if we have 10 rolls, we may only want to convert 2 rolls.
                    
                    Add Toggle Box called SELECT Tags.
                    This will display a list of On Hand Whse / Bin / Tag Numbers to Convert.
                    Only the items selected will be converted.
                    
                    In addition, for the finished goods tags converted, the Sharp Shooter Raw Materials TAG FILE must
                     create a new Raw Materails Tag Number and also transfer the Finished Goods Tag Number, RM Item C
                    ode, and RM Receipt Qty that was transferred on each NEW RM Tag Number.
                    
                    
                    The existing logic will be used for each tag converted..
                    Once converted, the finished goods tags are created as "A"djustments with the original quantity. 
                     The raw materials are created as receipts with the FG tag Number transferred.

                    This will show times and transactions for WIP.
                    
                    1) Add Toggle called Show Current Rates?
                    2) Add 3 new columns to the transactions drill down on Hours Folder.
                        Columns will be DL Rate, FO Rate, VO Rate that shows the rate when posted.
                        This will also allow changing the rates.
                    
                    Please note, rates may not exist in new DB fields from older version of software.
                    In this event, I think we should show the rates from the machine file.

                    New Version 10 DB fields for Actual Costs in WIP file.
                    Add Toggle Box called "Show Current Machine Rates or Job Rates".
                    Show Current Machine Rate is the current Logic which will use the Machine Rates for Standard Cost
                    s and Actual Costs on the JR3 report.

                    Add Toggle Box called "Show Current Machine Rates or Job Rates".
                    Show Current Machine Rate is the current Logic which will use the Machine Rates for Standard Cost
                    s and Actual Costs on the JR3 report.

                    Raw Material Tag 01004040080000001has 58000LF on Hand.
                    The Tag is for Jobs W2512 which has a sheet length of 25.625 inches.
                    Hence Expected Sheets are 58,000 x 12" / 25.625  = 27,162 Expected Sheets.
                    User will enter Stacking Height = 60"
                    Sheets per Pallet =  Stacking Height minus 5" Pallet divided by Caliper for Raw Material.
                         Or 60 - 5 / .018 = 3055 sheets per pallet.
                    WIP Tags =  Expected Sheets / Sheets per Pallet  
                    WIP Tags =  27,162 / 3055 
                    WIP Tags = 8.89  rounded to 9.
                    
                    Aso, to STOP scanning RM tags that have been already been scanned, we need to update the RM Tag F
                    ile.  Once the RM Tag is scanned, we need to update this RM tag status as WIP.
                    Meaning WIP tags were created so scanning same RM tag will show error.
                    Hopefully, we have a Staus Code in the RM Tag File???
                    Alternatively, we can scan the WIP tag for Job#,Form,Blank to see if this has a RM Tag#.

                    They enter the "Qty" in the actual amount of msf received, not in pounds received.  
                    Then they change the "PUOM" column from LB to MSF and the entry took.  
                    Now, when they enter the "Qty" column, and press tab, it converts from lbs to msf and changes the
                     PUOM designation to MSF.
                    
                    ASI Solution:
                    We need the conversioin to occur after the UOM field.
                    If purchase UOM and consumption OUM are not equal, the MU1 does a conversion.
                    This happens after you tab past the Qty field.
                    This conversion should only happen when tab past UOM field.
                    
                    Test,
                    PO# 100264 is for 20,000 LB, but the board is stocked/consummed by the MSF
                    Add Receipt for 300 MSF.   They type 300 and tab to enter MSF and the system does a conversion.

                    Copy Elite form and make the following changes.
                    1.   Remove the "Order Qty" from the first column.
                    2.   The Heading in the first column is "Part #" but for us it is printing the "item #". 
                          Change this to print the "Customer Part #".
                    3.   The second column lists the "PO #" and the "Job #". 
                           Remove the Job# on this column so only print the PO# only. 
                           It appears that is currently lists the item number separate by PO#, which we would want. 
                    4.    Increase the size of the "Ship To" address to make it stand out.
                    5.    This form does not print a line for each tag number and we would need to maintain this.
                           Meaning the Integer Value = 1 will summarize by FG Item.

                    Create Job standards to transfer all prep material to the job material and job labor.  
                    This includes new material types 7,8,9, X and Y.  Currently, this data is transferred to the PREP
                     Folder.    This is better logic because the PO and material receipts never ties together.   This
                     new change will support everything via materials or labor.
                    
                    Below were done on tasks by Eric.
                    Order Entry automatically create a raw material identical to the PREP code if the raw matererial.
                       The PREP file in job file will show the PREP raw materials code.    
                    PREP material codes are converted into unique raw goods material types:   
                    Prep "P"lates will become "7".
                    Prep Cutting "D"ies will become 8.
                    "F"lat Die will become X
                    "R"ule/Rotary Die will become "Y".  
                    "M"  will remain as "M"isc
                    
                    Please note, the new material types will be treated as "M"isc materials.
                    Prep / Die file need to be purchased as a Raw Material , therefore we will make prep / dies on th
                    e esimate transfer to the Material File of the Job file rather than the Prep Folder of Job File. 
                     RM material Code will be added to Prep file to cross reference to the estimate prep code so that
                     the system will automatically create the raw material item code.

N-U- -   02090801 E DB:  User File - Sales Rep Table to Assign Sales Rep Codes by User ID
                    User ID file needs definition of sales representatives similar to assigning customers.
                    The .NET application will limit customers by user ID.
                    Similar logic is needed to limit orders and reports by sales rep.
                    For example, Fibre has 20 sales reps.
                    The salesman file may have the codes 001 to 020.
                    However, the user ID may be their initials.
                    Hence user ID JRH may equal 001.
                    Also, a VP of sales may need to access all the sales reps reports.
                    We need this database table so the .NET application will provide a search on Salesman# that is li
                    mited to this new table.

                    Steps to Run Report
                    1)  User will define email addresses for Rep, Manager, etc. for each Sales Rep and r-invedt.r    
                       will be set to yes until E-mail notification system.
                    2)  User will run Report and will check Output to EMAIL.
                    3)  User will run the report once for each sales rep which will save the print parameters to a   
                        batch file that is stored under the menu Network Admin - Reports - Batch Maintance (N-R-1)                    -1)
                        Therefore if there are 10 sales reps, the report must be run 10 times and saved as Batch.
                    4)  User will execute the procedure via the N-R-3 run batch procedure menu.
                    
                    The report will run for each sales rep, then email to the email addresses assigned to the sales r
                    ep.   This process will repeat for each sales rep report defined on the batch.
                    Please note, running the batch of programs is a manual process but once executed will run until f
                    inished.  Additional programming time will be required to execute this procedure at a specific ti

                          The O-U-1 should reduce the Sell Price by the Discount percentage on the Item Folder.
                          There are no invoices for this item so I have no idea why the Q-Q-1 shows a different price
                          The  difference is the O-Q-1 shows the correct Price minus 3% discount on the item screen.

                    All items on the BOL will print on one BOL Pallet Tag.
                    The net result will print a new load tag for all items on the pallet.
                    Currently our customer must include multiple pallet tags to represent each pallet.
                    Many times the client will receive a pallet of different items from different SS pallet tags.

                    ASI customer using Sharp Shooter truncate the first 15 characters of the tag.
                    The ASI generated tag# is the FG item code followed by a sequential number.
                    To limit space on release ticket, only the sequential number is printing.
                    Loy Lange is manually typing a tag number which is less than 15 characters.
                    Therefore, the program is not printing their tag number if it is smaller than 15 characters.
                    New Mod would check N-K-1 FGRecept Integer Value .
                    If 1 then truncated the Tag number because they are using Sharp Shooter.

                    0 Dev. if Carrier is Truck, the F1 lookup should show Truck1, Truck2, Truck3.
                    Also, O-T-5 will import the trailer# from the O-T-1 file.

                    This also created a job number 200962 because there are other costs on the estimate.
                    The Quantity Produced shows ZERO on the browser.
                    The Line item screen shows the PO# for the purchase order for this farmout.
                    I received 25,000 via PO# 100934 listed on the line item folder.
                    The quantity produced should display the receipt quantity for the PO not the Job.
                    
                    This item is a purchased item that was estimated as purchased.
                    The field = P on the estimate folder and the FARM folder has the costs.
                    The FG item is properly created with the field = Purchased.
                    
                    Therefore, you need to display the quantity produced as the receipt quantity for the PO.
                    Modifiy code to include quantity produced from the Job as well as PO for purchased items.
                    Receipt quantity must be PO# on line item screen and THIS MUST BE A FG ITEM.
                    Meaning the PO# for sheets in normally on the line item folder, but would be ignored.

                    Advantzware does not allow adding a combo or tandem estimate on line item screen.
                    Therefore, the F1 on Estimate number should exclude these estiamte types.

                    The View Folder will allow all estimate types so that F1 is perfect.
                    This change is only for the F1 lookup on the Items Folder when the View Folder estimate is blank.
                    The F1 on Item folder limits search by Customer only at this time.
                    Please also limit by estimate type.

O-W- -   06230901 E Web Order Approval to Rebuild Job
                    All Web Orders are simply creating the line items and not checking credits or calculating the cos
                    t, which is fine as this speeds the order entry process for web customers.
                    
                    1) The Approve Button checks for FG items that are not created, but the cost is not rebuilt.
                         The solution is to move the logic from the Job File button called Rebuild Job Standards to t
                    he APPROVE button of web orders.  See any Web Order and note the cost is zero.
                    (ESP - Create job as well, which will update inventories)
                    
                    2) Web Orders for set estimate numbers are not aligned.  See Attached.

                    The two Purchase Orders that print on this report, should not.
                    The Finished Goods Receipt Quantity is less than the PO quantity but that is irrelavent.
                    The AP Invoice matches the Receipt Qty, therefore the  two PO's should not print.
                    PO 933 and PO# 1038 have been received and invoiced.
                    But the report shows the two items but show zero to invoice. 
                    The PO Line is closed because the the items have been received.
                    The PO View status is Open, and should be closed since the AP Invoice was Added.
                    The open status may be the reason the items show on the report.

                     allow me to print those checks.  The program should check to see if one or both of the criteria

                    As we understand how a report work, we add notes in helpdesk.
                    We need to copy those notes to the Report Screen so clients can read to understand how it works. 
                      
                    
                    For example T-R-9 has two date ranges.

                    ASI RESPONSE
                    Report has a labor date range and note date range.
                    Customer did not have proper date range for the note.
                    The labor transaction was added Feb 2 to 5th.  Note were added after Feb 5th..   
                    Therefore, a transaction on Feb 2 to Feb 5 may require a note range from Feb 2 to Feb 15th.   The
                     report first limits transactions to the labor dates, then limits notes based on the notes date.

                          Sometimes clients change this and we cannot get logged in.
                    
                    3)  Contact Folder, we need to add unlimited Contacts by Company
                          Similar to Names Database.
                           For Each Contact Add Following:
                             IP Address.

                             PC Anywhere Login Password.
                           This is needed as many clients have Login for Server and then other ID for Each Computer.
                            Also, reduce size of Title.
