                    New folder called FARM ill house multiple vendor pricing for this item to be used when calculatin
                    g the estimate.    First, when entering a "P" for purchased, the BUYOUT machine should transfer t
                    o the estimate.    New ASI department called FO for Farm Out that will automatically route when t
                    he item is Purchased.
                    
                    The estimate will pick the best price based on the estimated quantity, however a SPECIFIC  vendor
                     and Cost may be selected on the Vendor Matrix file.   If a specific vendor / cost is selected, t
                    hen that cost would be used when estimating and the other vendor costs would be ignored.
                    
                    When calcualting the estimate for PURCHASED items, only the vendor cost or vendor matrix on the F
                    ARM folder will be used plus the cost of freight from the customer shipto file.
                    All other material costs will be zero'd out when calculating the estimate for this component.
                    However if a machine is added to the routing such as a GLUER, then the glue material cost will be
                     added to the estimate.
                    
                    When the estimate is turned into an order and the finished goods item is created, the data will t

                    Need logic to automatically create the finished good item during order entry to link to the vendo

                    Create new logic so that the COPY button on this window will prompt from form / blank to form / b
                    lank to copy all forms.   Currently, this will only copy one item at a time.   Also, when they co
                    py an item, the blank dimensions convert back to the original blank dimensions rather then retain

                    See estimate 4001.   I estimated the same quantity, however each quantity has a different number 
                    of releases.    The program has errors when creating the quote and only 1 quantity will transfer 
                    to the quote.

                    When viewing job cost inquiries that have both estimated material and REAL material, the substitu
                    ted material and labor should not have the ESTIMATED standards in the Totals.
                    
                    We cannot change the job standards because the productivity reports need the standards to effecie

                    N-K-1 ProdCode.   Creates the FG  Inventory Production Code as New / Repeat.   Update mode should
                     allow user to change this to New or Repeat.  Therefore, only creating a new item will automatica
                    lly set the Production Code Field.
N-K-1-   01090610 E N-K RelPost to determine the creation of Backorders
                    Relpost dictates how the BOL is created.  Therefore, this flag should also dictate how the backor
                    der is created.    If each release creates a separate bill of lading as when the character value 
                    is BOL/REL then the backorder should create a separate release for each original release.   If th
                    e character value were BOL, then the items would be grouped by shipdate and shipto location on th
                    e release just as they were grouped together on the bill of lading.

                     the warehouse / bin from the FG bin file.  This must also validate Tag#'s in the FG Bin File.   
                    Likewise, the warehouse and bin location should transfer to the BOL line and must match the FG Bi

                    d via the N-Q-3 utility.    This utility will store the old FG item code in the FG items TOTALs f
                    older.  Customer Code will become ************* and the FG item will be transferred to the TOTAL 
                    cross reference file. 
                    
                    Also,  Southpak says that this use to MERGE data if the new FG Item already existed.

                    See Order 5293 and 5292.   When I add an order and error appears on E-item.
                    No vendor cost matrix is created.   The estimated Cost matrix from the estimated item.  Hopefully
                     we do not end up with two FG items for this estimate.  ie a blank FG item and the new FG item.
                    
                    Also,  order 5293 is for a set.  The components have ZERO allocated quantity.  The manufactured i
                    tem should also have an On Order Qty but this is zero also.  The Purchased Item should not have a
                    n On Order Qty.
                    
                    Lastly, if the N-K-1 OEAUTOFG is YES, this should also create a PO for the Purchased Item, which 
                    would then update the On Order Qty.    The PO for the purchased item did not happen.
O-U-1-   04130510 E Add Case Count, Case/Pallet, Partial to Order Line Item.

                    Add Case Count,  Case/Pallet,  Partial to the Order Lines. 
                    The logic for N-K-1 OECOUNT would not be needed if we had the unitization fields below.
                    When adding orders, we should import all the fields from the estimate.   When updating the fields
                     on the order, this would update the finished good item and estimate fields.    Please note, only
                     the set header could be updated in the estimate unless all components are shown.
O-U-7-   01160610 E Loadtag Creation to Default FG item to Blank
                    When 1st accessing the Loadtag program the FG item should default to and from to blank.
                    They periodically click the Save button and create Loadtags for all the inventory.
                    When selecting an order number, order range or job number range will then default the FG items nu
                    mbers.
P-U-1-   12140508 E Delete PO Line must delete RM Tags for the PO Line
                    If a PO Line item is deleted, then any loadtags that have been created must be deleted.
                    If the line has receipts posted, then the PO cannot be deleted.
P-U-3-   01060606 E PO to print Change Date and Updated when Item Updated
                    Clients may print the PO just to review the details before sending the PO to the vendor.
                    Under this scenario, the reprint shows the PO as a CHANGE ORDER.    
                    Add option on Print Screen when Reprinting PO to Set as Original.   This will change the status o
                    f the line from updated to New or Original so that the CHANGE ORDER does not appear on the purcha
                    se order.

                    Same logic should apply for Fiber PO form.   MISC materials should not print the Flute, Test, but
                     should print the Width and Length.  Only "B"oard should print Flute and Test.
