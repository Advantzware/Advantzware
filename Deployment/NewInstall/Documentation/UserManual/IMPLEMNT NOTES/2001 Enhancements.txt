                    and number of quantity of sheets produced will add to the Plate number of Impressions. Likewise, 
                    when entering data on the Diecutter, the waste and run production will update the number of impre
                    ssions in the die file.
                    
                    The PR department should update the spec Plate# die and and the DC department should update the D

                    date and userid.  If the user selects Update, the new and old quantities would display and would 
                    be saved.  Likewise, updating quote would copy date and user ID.

E-C- -   05060201 E GUI Die#,Plate# Browser
                    Add Die# and Plate# to Estimate browser.  The character version FIND allows 
                    searching the Die# or Plate#, hence we need to move this to all estimates.OPRINT character value

                       out format of the quote form.

                     image is the correct size for our box design screen.   As an alternative, should be simply promp
                    t for a file name of image?
E-C- -   09160205 E Estimate to Print Vendor Name
                    Print the Label Vendor to the right of the Weight in the materials section.

                    Import from ASIIMAGES.
                    Save should save to BOXIMAGES.  Better would be BOXIMAGES/CUSTOMER CODE
                    
E-C- -   09190201 E New Estimate should build box design immediately
                    Add new estimate for RSC.  The style file has the box design number, which has the image.
                    This image should transfer directly to the estimate box design screen.   ok
                    
                    Whenever the blank dimensions are changed, the system should prompt to update the LAYOUT folder a
                    nd the BOX DESIGN Dimensions exactly as in add mode.

E-C- -   10070208 E Blank = Sheet Warning for Rev Corr not Valid
                    When the layout folder has the REV CORR set to Blank cross grain, the sheet size will properly sw
                    itch.   The problem is the N-K-CE W>L  warning message appears.  The solution is that when the RE
                    V CORR flag is B, then the blank width must look at the sheet lenght and the blank lenght should 
                    look at the sheet width.  
E-C- -   10160206 E Print Box Design on Estimate Hardcopy
                    Add new radio button on print selection screen, when printing Estimate Hard Copy to print the Box

                    e prints.  The entire box design must print, so if this prints on the same page as the estimate t
                    otals, then we cannot print half the box on one page and the other half on another page.
E-C- -   10250206 E Expand Board Descriiption Name on Layout Folder

E-C- -   10290205 E Setup Charges for Non Board Material
                    Move current logic for board setup charges to all other materials on the estimate.  Hence any cor
                    rugated material could have a setup charge in the cost matrix.  This setup charge must be added t
                    o each material added to a corrugated estimate.   
                    
                    This mod took 6 hours to program and test.   Quoted 3 hours.

                    be calculated as EA if this character value is EA.  If the value is M then the current logic will
                     be used.   If the value is EA, then the price will be divided by 1000 and the UOM will be conver
                    ted to EA.

                    When an estimate# exists on the quote, logic should work differently.  The item must be identical
                     to the estimate.  When I press Update and tab, I get error message on the size.  UPDDATE should 
                    never allow changing the FG item# either with or without when an estimate# exists.  UPDATE should
                     only allow changes to the  Description fields.  
                    
                    Delete and Add would be better logic, hence UPDATE should never change the FG item#.

                    t and component, now we need a new field for shipping method.  ie an assembled set may be shipped
                     in a packaging as a set or shipped on separate pallets and even on separate trucks.
I-F- -   01050202 E DB. Set Maint, BOM Level#
                    Add Set Maintenance to FG Menu.  Add DB field called BOL Level to Each Line.  This will add the a
                    bility to add multiple indented levels of bill of materials.multiple printing panels on one sheet
                     and often a length and width partition are run side by side on the same sheet.  Add additional o
                    ption to Add blank to a Form in corrugated sets. 
I-F- -   02010211 E GUI DB: FG Cost Matrix
                    New finished goods cost matrix folder identical to raw material cost matrix for defining costs to
                     purchase finished goods items also known as farmouts. 
                    le should hav a database field called modules so that ASI can define the module for each control 
                    parameter.
I-F- -   02180201 E GUI DB: Partial Pallet
                    GUI DB Field:  Add Partial Pallet for FG Bin/Job File and other fields necessary to track pallets
                    .  Currently, we store the total quantity and pallet count, but do not keep how many are in the p
                    artial pallet.  In reality, there could be 10 pallets at 500 and 4 pallets at 600, but the curren
                    t database can not handle this.   The problem is that the bill of lading can be created with the 
                    wrong unit counts.  For example, if I receive 10 @500 and 1@ 600 to item file shows 5600 and 500 
                    per unit.  When I create the BOL, it shows 11 @ 500 and 1 @ 100.
I-F- -   02180206 E GUI FG DB's for Corrugators
                    GUI DB files/fields.  New Field Called Sheet?  This will indicate that this item is a Sheet item 
                    for corrugator plants that sell sheets. ie the width, lenght and scoring must be stored in the or
                    der entry file.  
                    Add new BOM file just like Raw materials for Defining Paper for Medium/Liner.
                     
                     FG Item and ADDERS including 10 Levels with each having Qty, UOM, Price, Setup Charge. 
                     
I-F- -   03070201 E Item# on Book Icon
                    Display the FG Item# on the Notes Icon when adding notes.  This would be very helpful for sets, t
                    andem and combo runs to verify the notes are for the correct FG item number.
I-F- -   08100101 E GUI FG File - Notes
                    FG Item File must be Built.  The following Folders must be created.  The Item Screen, Totals Scre

                     folder with all the ink colors and coatings should be listed just like the RFQ folder.
                    
                    Tested: Cant Enter estimate 112 for item 10x10x10.  
                            Cant Enter STOCK as Customer for item 10x10x10.
                    
                    Also Change Spec Notes to ICON
I-F- -   12300203 E Taxable Field in FG Item File
                    New RefTable Logical field called TAXABLE.  Add to FG Item File.   During order entry, modify log
                    ic that looks at customer file as taxable to also look at the Finished Goods taxable flag.   Henc
                    e, a customer may be taxable, but certain items may be tax exempt based on this flag.

                    on the job number. 
                    
                    F1 on Warehouse and Bin should only show the valid codes from the bin file.

I-U-5-   10040205 E FG Post to Auto Issue Materials
                    New S-8-AUTOISSU logic to post materials when the posting finished goods
                    rather than when the job closes.  Current logic will post the amount of
                    material directly from the job file based on the original job quantity.   New
                    character option to be FGPOST or JOBCLOSE.  Current logic will be JOBCLOSE.
                    New logic called FGPOST will multiply the total finished goods quantity posted
                    by the ratio of each component material on a job.
                    
                    When the job is closed or reopened, no material issues will be created when
                    the flag is FGPOST.
                    
                    Please note, older logic in our system had utilized the character value as a
                    default for the Bin location, but this logic was recently changed to default
                    directly from the raw material bin file or item file.  Hence the old logic
                    should not be required, however if the raw material location is blank, then
                    the warehouse and bin must default from the Customer X warehouse and bin
                    location.

                    job sheet size x sheets issued / 144,000 divided by number out = 7.1519095.
                    Existing logic allows issues for stocked real rolls to enter the number of
                    sheets finished on the sheeter, then converts the number of sheets (EA) into
                    the consumption unit of measure (ie MSF,TON,LF).  This works perfect unless
                    the sheeter slits the gross sheet into two.  The estimate number out is 2 x 1
                    hence the number of MSF issues should be divided by the number out on the
                    gross sheet.

                    To make room,  Change Estimate # to Estimate.  Delete Run# label.  Change Job Number to Job# with
                    out Run# label.   Delete the order date as it is not needed.    Expand Customer Code to allow all
                     eight characters.   Delete NAME as this duplicates the company name.  
                    
                    On the Release Screen change following labels.:

                    ort.    If the user clicks the ITEM button, then only the item will import.   
                    
                    Also, add TOGGLE box next to the FG Item code to select individual items.   When clicking the  IT
                    EMS  button, then all selected FG items for each order will move to the release screen.
                    
                    Currently, the user selects the order, then the system prompts to import all items on the order. 
                     Move this logic to the Order Button.      We will only need that prompt, if the user manually ty

O-U-1-   07240201 E Move Quoted Price Logic from V5.11
                    When N-K-QUOPRINT = FIBRE, the quantity must match the quoted quantity and the sell price cannot 
                    be changed.   This was done on character task 07160201.  Move to GUI.  Original price was quoted 
                    for both packages.  
                    
                    When QUOPRINT = FIBRE, adding new orders will not allow changing the sell
                    price.  Also, the quote quantity must match the order quantity, otherwise the
                    system will not allow entry of the quantity.  An error message will display
                    that the quantity has not been quoted.  In any event, the price cannot be
                    modified.
                    
                    This logic must be be moved to the new GUI software system.
O-U-1-   10070210 E Taxable Customer should default items to Taxable
                    When adding an order for either an estimate or stock items,  if the customer code is Taxable or t
                    he order header is defined with a TAX code, then all the items should default to taxable.  Likewi
                    se, the misc.  charges and freight charges should also default to taxable if the order control fi
                    le fields Charge tax on freight and Charge Tax on prep charges are taxable yes as defined with a 
                    Check.

                    alled Cust# and Cust Name.    You will need to add the Customer Name to the browsers as well.
O-U-1-   11070207 E Adding line items slow.

                    Add new release for any item.  The N-K-OERELEAS logic is not used.  No matter what the character 
                    value, the due date defaults to the last ship date from the header screen.  The default should be
                     Due Date or Last Ship Date from the Line Item Screen. If logical value is NO.  No releases shoul

                    The only good logic, is that when orders are deleted they still exist with a Delete Status.  The

Hot Keys Task#    T Overview
-------- -------- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Empire is the main one to be done for pacific.
O-U-4-   10300205 E E-mail capability on Order Acknowledgement Form
                    Atttachment does not show Xprint file.   Characters not formatted properly.
O-U-5-   09090203 E XPRINT for BRICK Job Ticket
                    N-K-JOBCARDC  = RFC Job Ticket form must be converted into XPRINT graphic.
                    This will print from the bitmapped picture of a box design as a replacement to the current text b
                    ox.    We will need the ability to type text on the picture if possible.   
                    
                    Ideally, the job ticket will print the bit mapped picture if it exists on the estimate, otherwise
                     this will print the curren text box design.
O-U-5-   09160204 E Brick Job Ticket to Print Metric
                    Job Ticket to Print Metric Dimensions in place of the imperial dimensions when the estimate field
                     called Metric is YES.   This must convert the feet and inches into the metric equivalent.  Pleas
                    e note, the corrugated dimensions now print in 16'ths such as 8.08 but the database should be sto
                    red as 8.50.  The 8.50 is the dimensions that must be converted. 
                    
                    JobCardC = BRICK.  Change machine description to print machine code.  When
                    JobcardC=Brick, the Metric flag on the estimate will be updateable.  When this
                    flag is YES, then the job card will print metric dimensions in place of the
                    current 16th's of inches.
                    
                    Also, to right of box design description print CorrDir: Vertical or
                    Horizontal.  Truncate box description to print spaces so that the box design
                    number prints then the description without the label description.  When page
                    two Rev Corr is NO, then the word Vertical will print.  When Rev Corr is YES,
                    then the word Horizontal will print.
                    
O-U-5-   09180204 E Job Ticket Enhancement
                    Job Ticket changes.   Erase panel and score headings.  Indent each panel one column.
                    Also, many older clients when converted, the designs will be text only.  Print the # - and | rath
                    er than convert.   They will have to convert into images, otherwise just the text will print.
O-U-5-   11080203 E JOBCARDC in Landscape
                    Jobcardc should only have ASI as an option.   This will print with Xprint is either landscape ro 
                    protrait.    The font should not be modifable.  This should simply click portrait or landscape.
                    The font and lines per inche should not be updateable.  This just creates support calls and probl
                    ems.  
                    
                    Landscape mode does not fit on the page.
O-U-5-   11080204 E Pacific Job Ticket
                    New JobcardC = Pacific.  Box Design will print exactly like the new format..  The arrows that cur
                    rently display will not print.    The arrows printing inside the box will not print either.   All
                     other data should print as shown.   
                     
                    The notes will print on page two.  Ship Notes will be separated from the Manufacturing Notes by a
                     skipped line similar to a paragraph is spaces.
                     
                    Data will print in a fixed text font identical to the current factory ticket prints.   All labels
                     will print in a small font similar to the sample ticket.
                    
                    We cannot print mulitple font types for the data fields, otherwise this must be quoted on a time 
                    and material at $100 per hour.    Data fields must be fixed fonts.   ie a 1 an W take up the same
                     space.  Please advise.
                     
                    Tticket will prints both Part number and Set.

                    Also, horizontal lines not printing on his printer.
                    
                    Spec Notes only printing 1 line on job ticket.  Print Job 637.  Note the notes stop printing.
                    
O-U-7-   12100111 E LoadTag Creation
                    Convert from character.  Screen developed, but not errors appear.  No file is created.  
                    
                    How much longer would it take to create Excell spreadsheet file rather than ASCII file?  The load
                    tag program would then pull from the file.   The benefit is that the user could modify this file,
                     before printing via Bar One or Bar Code Label.
O-U-8-   10180202 E Create Load Tags by Job# or Order#
                    Allow creating load tag file for either orders or stock job numbers such as S729.  This will need
                     to find the bundle count and pallet count from the estimate.

                    nless the REPRINT option is selected.
                    
                    Manufactured items which are created from estimates will generate a job ticket, however finished 
                    goods items that are purchased, such as farm outs, do not generate a job ticket.  This report dup
                    licates the paperwork that should be given to a purchasing agent to buy the items.
                    
                    Alternatively, some clients print the order acknowledgment, however that is not as exact.  For cl
                    ients that sell many stock box and distribution items, this report may be cumbersome.  The best r
                    eport for those type of orders, would be the reorder advise report, which prints out only the ite
                    ms that fall below the reorder level.   Thus, many orders for the same item would only require a 
                    new purchase order when this level fell below the reorder level.

                    mport from the raw material estimated cost matrix for that vendor.
P-U-1-   11190215 E PO to import FG Matrix with Setup/Freight Cost
                    First, we will add a new FG cost matrix by vendor similar to the raw materials cost matrix.  This
                     will be for use in purchasing Finished Goods.  This matrix will have a setup charge next to each
                     quantity.  The setup charge label will read,  Setup/Freight Charge.    When adding a purchase or
                    der, the program will select the correct cost for the finished good item for the vendor on the pu
                    rchase order.   The unit of measure on the cost matrix will be used as the Purchased UOM if the m
                    atrix is defined for the vendor on the purchase order.
                    
                    The Purchase Order will print the Unit Cost of the Item and Print a Separate Cost for the Setup/F
                    reight Charge, however the view screen in the po will total the cost each plus setup charge into 
                    a total cost per the unit of measure.
                    
                    The FG receipt program will import the cumulative cost per unit of measure on the purchase order.
                       This unit of measure must be converted into the consumption/stock unit of measure.  It must be
                     either EA or M for finished goods.  Please note, the FG cost matrix could be entered as MSF for 
                    farmouts for boxes, hence the MSF cost must be converted into cost per EA or /M.
                    This cost will include the freight or setup charge.  The item totals screen will house the total 
                    width, lenght and square feet per item.

                    BOLWHSE current values are Shipto and FGBIN.  FGBIN currently imports multiple jobs when the job#
                     is blank.  Add new option called FIFO. This will work just like FGBIN, however when the job# is 
                    on the order, the Bill of Lading will import from the first job# to the most current job# until t
                    he release quantity is fulfilled.   It would be possible that the actual job# on the order may no
                    t be shipped on the Bill of Lading if previous jobs quantity on hand could fulfill the orders rel

Z- - -   09060201 E Font / Portrait Defaults for Forms/Reports
                    All forms and reports should print in portrait mode.   The only exception are the HOP and ASI quo
                    te form and the HOP jobcardF which use wider paper in landscape mode.  The HOP job ticket prints 
                    in 17 pitch mode.    All forms such as invoices, bill of ladings, quotes,  etc. should print in 1
                    0 pitch equivalent.  All reports should print in 17 pitch equivalent for 8 1/2 x 11" printers and
                     10 pitch equivalent for 132 column wide carriage printers.
                    
                    The only exception to the report is H-R-4 which requires a wide printer in 17 pitch mode because 
                    this is more than 132 columns.
                    
                    Forms are the highest priorities.
                    
                    After writing include, let BJ move to all reports.

                    This will be used at the AICC corrugated conference on September 25, 26.  I will depart on Sept 2
                    4 about 12:00 Noon.
                    
                    My Laptop will need another Icon that will point the Addon V9 to the same database that the Local
                     GUI looks at.  ie copy local addon icon and copy local DB to another directory.
                    This will allow me to run both GUI and Addon together, rather than have an NT operating sytems on
                     my laptop.   Keep the Local addon9 as it is in case I need to demo the integration between addon
                    s and gui.

                    When printing forms, the font 10 should default with ? lines per page.  (Must Test)
                    When printing reports in portrait, the font  11 should default with 99 lines per page.
